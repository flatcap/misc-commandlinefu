                                        POSIX requires this "string truncating" functionality.

                                        might as well use it, at least for very small tasks where invoking sed and using RE is overkill.

                                        You need to quote "$a" in the echo or it'll drop multiple spaces from the input. e.g.
                                </p><code>echo "a b"|se a</code>
                                <p>
                                        a b
                                </p>
                        </div>

                                        splante: thank you.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        i have also used this one-liner as a simple way to transform tabs to spaces,
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        e.g., where output from a program wraps on the terminal solely because it uses tabs, making it more difficult to read.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        fstat | se pattern
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        if we quote the "$a" variable then of course we'll get the tabs.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        but in other situations quoting "$a" is useful. e.g. to prevent the shell from expanding certain characters. imagine if some program is listening on an internet socket, and you do
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        netstat | se LIS
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        you might not like what you get for the output, unless you have put quotes around "$a".
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        it seems this website might also benefit from some added attention to shell quoting: i can only see one space between a and b in your example.
