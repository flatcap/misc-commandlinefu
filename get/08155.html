As a result, both the correct and incorrect commands are in my history file. I wanted a simple way to remove the incorrect command so I don't run it by mistake.

                                                        Wouldn't history -d #, where # is the number of the mistyped command, have been faster more efficient?

                                                        `history -d` will work if you know the exact offset and all you wish to do is delete a line. You could do a `history|tail` to be sure of that offset so to not accidentally blow away the wrong command
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        .
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        But this function lets you edit your history file too. So you could remove that password from the command line mysql querry. or you could append that successful command with a comment like thus :
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        .
                                                </p><code>ssh user@example.com #insert history keyword here</code>
                                                <p>
                                                        .
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        It's also faster if you wish to wipe the last ten commands
                                                </p>
                                        </div>

                                                <p>
                                                        eh () { history -a ; vi + ~/.bash_history ; history -r ; }
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        .

                                                <p>
                                                        adding the `+` when evoking `vi` causes the file to open at the very last line. Since you usually want to edit something within say 20 lines of the bottom, this is useful but optional upgrade
                                                </p>
