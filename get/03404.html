                                                        i DID write that into the description, which mystically got lost during posting the command.

                                                        things needed for this to work: (1) they tell me the screen binary must be setuid, (2) multiuser mode must be enabled via the -x option or 'multiuser on' command inside screen, and (3) users must be added via 'acladd username' command. At least that does it on debian/ubuntu systems.

                                                        I have written Windows Desktop Workspace manager with automated terminal for CYGWIN.

                                                        Each terminal window has built-in TELNET or TELNET-TLS server that allows to share terminal session with remote users via TELNET protocol. Check it out.

                                                        Shared session is persistent and can be accessed from anywhere by TELNET or TELNET-TLS client.
