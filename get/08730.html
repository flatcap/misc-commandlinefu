                                        When you press TAB twice in your prompt, bash tells you something like
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        "Display all 4567 possibilities? (y or n)"
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        But when you press "y" you only get the list in the terminal output and, if you want to save it to a file, you have to copy it by hand from the vterm screen. With this utility you save the list to a file or pipe it to another command at will
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        You can use the file saved list to grep for a particular pattern, useful if you are searching for a command but you only remember a few letters

                                        why not just use Ctrl + R (if you are using bash) instead of saving to a file and looking up? Is there much difference?
                                </p>
                        </div>

                                        To you use Ctrl+r, the command you are looking for have to be in the bash-history, if you haven't typed in yet in the box you are working at or you just used long time ago (and it was dropped from the bash-history), this could be a good way to find it out
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Also, with the file you can look an overview of the programs available in your system
                                </p>
