                                                        Assuming you're separating source and destination names by tab characters, try this to avoid issues with spaces and such:
                                                </p><code>tr "\t\n" "\0" &lt;file_with_columns_of_names | xargs --null -n 2 mv</code>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class="comment comment1 body">
                                                <p>
                                                        But it will build something like that :
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        mv my first filename my second filename
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        Maybe with -i and mv "{}" "{}" but i don't know enough xargs to be sure
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        And if someone know how to deal with that, because it often cause me trouble for something like that :
                                                </p><code>for file in *.xls ; do ...</code>
                                                <p>
                                                        ( yes, xls, because only windows user will put space in filename and yes i'm trolling a little)
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        Because it will run badly with space. And i have never find a way to tell him to quote filename (it always end running with "my,first,filename").
                                                </p>
                                        </div>
                                </div>
                        </div>
                </div>
