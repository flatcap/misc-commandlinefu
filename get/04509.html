					Neat. :)

					Under MacOS using Terminal, if you set the height and width to absurdly huge values, this will perfectly fullscreen the Terminal window.

					Nice. Of course if you're using gnome-terminal, then there's no need: change the shortcut to run:
				</p><code>gnome-terminal --maximize</code> <code>gnome-terminal --full-screen</code>

					Doesn't work in PuTTY on Windows ;oP

					If you know what size you want to make your xterm (e.g. the 70 &amp; 180) you can start a larger xterm with:
				</p><code>xterm -geometry 70x180</code>
				<p>
					(or use -geo for geometry)
				</p>
				<p>
					and place it in the right place on screen with:
				</p><code>xterm -geo 70x180+5+10</code>

					This is typically something I've done by editing /usr/share/vte/termcap/xterm, but that tends to get reset a lot on upgrades. This is good because I can just add it to my .bashrc, which has the added benefit of surviving full reinstalls and new machines (I sync my .bashrc around). Nice :)

					Good to know... gnome-terminal will let you say:
				</p>
				<p>
					resize -s 70 180
				</p>

					It would be a lot better to do this with tput(1) -- assuming you have the one from ncurses, at least -- rather than hard-coding the control sequences like that.
