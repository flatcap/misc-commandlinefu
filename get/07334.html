                                        delete multiple files from git index that have already been deleted from disk. this is pretty terrible, I'm looking for a better way.

                                I'll just comment it (no alternative version). Your solution is good enough.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                1. It's one of these 'awk which is basically "cut"' cases.
                        </p><code>git status |grep deleted | cut -d" " -f3 | xargs git rm</code>
                        <p>
                                2. You can combine grep and awk jobs:
                        </p><code>git status | awk '/deleted/{print $3}' | xargs git rm</code>
                        <p>
                                3. An equivalent version without xargs would look like this. (Just in case you're interested in commands you're gona to execute: replace 'sh' with 'less')
                        </p><code>git status | awk '/deleted/{print "git rm " $3}' | sh</code>
                </div>
        </body>
