                                        Have you ever had to scp a file to your work machine in order to copy its contents to a mail? xclip can help you with that. It copies its stdin to the X11 buffer, so all you have to do is middle-click to paste the content of that looong file :)

                                        Thanks for this! Does anyone know of a way to paste into the kill buffer instead? Sometimes I am logged into a remote machine and there is no X functionality. (BTW, Mac has pbcopy and Windows has clip.exe for this capability)...

                                        Correction: I didn't mean "paste into kill buffer", I meant "copy arbitrary text into the kill buffer for later pasting"
                                </p>
