                                                                This command repeatedly gets the specified process' stack using pstack (which is an insanely clever and tiny wrapper for gdb) and displays it fullscreen. Since it updates every second, you rapidly get an idea of where your program is stuck or spending time.

                                                                The 'tac' is used to make the output grow down, which makes it less jumpy. If the output is too big for your screen, you can always leave the 'tac' off to see the inner calls. (Or, better yet--get a bigger screen.)

                                                        This sounds very neat, but I can't find a copy of pstack for Mac OS X. Anyone know of one?

                                                        AFAIK, it's just a gdb script, so it shouldn't be OS-specific, though perhaps it would have to be tweaked slightly to work on OSX. Not sure where the canonical version is, but Debian seems to be getting it from RedHat.

                                                        ubuntu pstack seems not work, gdb alias is:

                                                <p>
