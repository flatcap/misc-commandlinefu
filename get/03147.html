This command has to be run when firefox is not running, or it will exit displaying the pid of the firefox running.

                                                        The first part isn't strictly necessary, right? Since sqlite will fail gracefully if firefox is already running? I think you could use find to do everything, with an admittedly odd-looking -exec argument:
                                                </p><code>find ~/.mozilla/firefox -name "*.sqlite" -exec bash -c "&lt;&lt;&lt;'vacuum;' sqlite {}" \;</code>
                                                <p>
                                                        using "here documents" to substitute a string for stdin. Putting echo before bash helps to see what commands would be run without running them :-).

                                                        Yeah. I guess so. I was ujst being extra carefull with the pid part.

                                                <p>
                                                        With the "do everything with find, I do completely agree with you. And it is better too, because it will correctly handle if there is a newline in the file name. Whereas my code will fail miserably.

                                                        But I would like to point out that you need to be carefull with your quotes.
