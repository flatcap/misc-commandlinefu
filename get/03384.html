However, if the command is very complex it might be difficult to recall the parts that will uniquely identify this command. Using the above trick it's possible to label your commands and access them easily by pressing ^R and typing the label (should be short and descriptive).

                                                        The part after the '#' isn't executed since it's a comment for bash, while that part can be used when searching through the command string.

                                                        You could also make a function to do this, and save it in either your ~/.profile file or in another file sourced from that file. The second option is nice because you can create a set of libraries with functions for particular purposes, and rather than loading them all with .profile, include them on demand with eg
                                                </p><code>source "~/bin/database-functions.bash"</code>
                                                <p>
                                                        This helps to keep your shell environment lean, because otherwise you might end up including a ton of code that you almost never use.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        Another option is to make each function a shell script in its own file and save them in ~/bin. You can add that directory to your $PATH variable, again in ~/.profile, with
                                                </p><code>echo 'PATH="${PATH}:$HOME/bin"' &gt;&gt;~/.profile</code>
                                                <p>
                                                        Once this is done and you've logged in again, scripts in your ~/bin directory that have been made executable with
                                                </p><code>chmod u+x ~/bin/"$script_name"</code>
                                                <p>
                                                        will be available to be used like other system commands.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        This would let you use parameters in the same way as a shell script.

                                                        You might only do this when you need that functionality in your programs. Do you use the "gmail unread mails" commands here on <a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com?" rel="nofollow">www.commandlinefu.com?</a> Why bother create functions/libraries? Just add "#gmail" at the end and you're done.

                                                        That won't happen, simply because by default the number of commands in history is limited. So if you do not (re)use some commands they will be "pushed back" by new entered commands and eventually disappear.

                                                        Bring up the command using Ctrl+R, press End key and change the label. You need to run the command so that it will be saved in .bash_history.
