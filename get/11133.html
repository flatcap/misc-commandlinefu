                                        Okay, commands like this are a bit of a personal peeve. awk(1) operates on a /pattern/ {action} paradigm and yet I see people leave out the /pattern/ portion of an awk command all the time, opting to use grep or sed instead. You'll save yourself some typing and time if you include the /pattern/ with your {action}.

                                                This is a 'killall' command equivalent where it is not available.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                Prior to executing it, set the environment variable USERNAME to the username, whose processes you want to kill or replace the username with the $USERNAME on the command above.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                Side effect: If any processes from other users, are running with a parameter of $USERNAME, they will be killed as well (assuming you are running this as root user)
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                                [-9] in square brackets at the end of the command is optional and strongly suggested to be your last resort. I do not like to use it as the killed process leaves a lot of mess behind.

                                                Kill all processes belonging to a user, with a minimum of resource usage. Great for the times when a user fork-bombs the system and it's difficult to login or run commands.

                                Not bad, but you can save a few characters by changing printf to print:
                        </p><code>ps wwwwuax|awk '/command/ { print "kill -9 "$2 }'|/bin/sh</code>
                        <p>
                                Then another few by using a subshell execution rather than the pipe:
                        </p><code>kill -9 $(ps wwwwuax|awk '/command/ { print $2 }')</code>
                        <p>
                                This works, but it exposes a bug in the original command.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                Awk's pattern matches awk itself.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                                In the original command the error message is lost.
