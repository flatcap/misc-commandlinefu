                                        -exec works better and faster then using a pipe

                                                doesn't do case-insensitive filenames like iname but otherwise likely to be faster

                                it would seem so yes, but it's really much closer to a tie here. In -exec {} + mode find invokes as many grep instances as xargs does, and the pipe has little overhead. What you really want is a recursive grep as originally posted by sitaram:
                        </p><code>grep -r --include="*.[ch]" TODO .</code>
                </div>
