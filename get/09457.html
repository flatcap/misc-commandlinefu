                                        It happens that sometime you remember that you used a special command short time before and you want to check the command again.

                                        Just hold Ctrl-R and start typing a string (e.g. ssh). The shell will search for that string in the command history. Keep pressing Ctrl-R to cycle through all commands matching pattern. This works in other "sub-shells" too, like a python interactive session.
