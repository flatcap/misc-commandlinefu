                                                                You could do the following, however, brace expansion with {} is not defined in POSIX, and therefore not guaranteed to work in all shells. But, if it does, it's more convenient (although it's certainly not less typing):
                                                        </p><code>cp -r {*,.??*} /dest</code>

                                                                Sometimes there are times when I need to cp(1), mv(1) or rm(1) files recursively, but don't want to traverse the previous directory by following ../../../../ etc out of the current directory. This command prevents that. The secret sauce is ".??*". The file globbing ensures that it must start with a dot, and be followed by at least two characters. So, three characters must exist in the filename, which eliminates "." and "..".

                                                        I think you've missed out a dot in the second example? {*,.??*}

                                                        It could also be written, saving 1 char, as:
                                                </p><code>cp -r {,.??}* /dest</code>

                                                        What's wrong with 'cp -r . /dest'?

                                                        @Fudo- That command does not copy hidden files- only non-hidden files in the current directory.

                                                        What about one-character hidden files? Like .a

                                                <p>
                                                        I think it's incomplete.

                                                        if you want all files (including hidden) just don't use file globbing:
                                                </p><code>cp -r ./ /dest</code>
                                        </div>
