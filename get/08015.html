                                        ':r!ls -l' results in listing the files in the current directory and paste it into vi

                                        This filters the current line through a command, rather than just running a command and adding the output to the buffer.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        For instance, if you start with the line "example" and press !!, then type "wc -c" and press enter, "example" will be replaced with "8". (7 characters in "example", plus the newline.)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        So the contents of the line you do the !! on are given as standard input to the program. If all you wanted was to run the command with no input that might not be what you want. So to run the command and capture output, but not give any input, you want something like
                                </p><code>:r !date</code>
