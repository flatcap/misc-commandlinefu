There is no output, but here's the output from xrandr so you can see the input to the sed regex. It is simply grabbing the first word from any line that says "SUCHANDSO connected"

I've heard that at night blue (short wavelength) lights are particularly bad for your diurnal clock. That may be a bunch of hooey, but it is true that redder (longer wavelength) colors are easier on my eyes at night.

I'm doing it this way because of a misfeature in xrandr(1), which requires an output be specified but has no programmatic way of querying available outputs. Someone needs to patch up xrandr to be shell script friendly or at least add virtual outputs named "PRIMARY" and "ALL".

Put the contents of these into files in your path (e.g., your home directory), mark them executable, and then run one of them. As long as you stay logged on, they will keep running each other at the correct time.
