				<p>
					bs = buffer size (basically defined the size of a "unit" used by count and skip)
				</p>
				<p>
					count = the number of buffers to copy (16m * 32 = 1/2 gig)
				</p>
				<p>
					skip = (32 * 2) we are grabbing piece 3...which means 2 have already been written so skip (2 * count)
				</p>
				<p>
					i will edit this later if i can to make this all more understandable
