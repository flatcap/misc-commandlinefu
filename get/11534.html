                                                        A couple of points. First the readline command is "ctrl-x ctrl-x". If you don't use ctrl for the second one it doesn't work. Secondly, it doesn't necessarily move you to the beginning, or end. It moves you to the last 'mark', which if undefined is the beginning. The second time you use it, it will put the cursor back where it was (not necessarily the end).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        You can set the 'mark' by using 'ctrl-@'.
                                                </p>

                                                        Thanks! I will update it. I found it randomly and did notice a bit later that it was based on a "mark" as you say. Thanks for the 'ctrl-@' tip.
