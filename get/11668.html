                                                                Yes the "/tmp/socket" is the serial port socket connection which is set by the user in VMWare. In VMWare Player, this is referred to as a "named pipe". `socat` uses the term "UNIX domain socket" (from the manpage). So change "/tmp/socket" to whatever you had set in VMWare.

                                                                Omit the ",raw" if you want to keep the parent shell's job control (ctrl-c, ctrl-z, etc). Personally, I like to use ",raw" as shown above because it allows me to use ctrl-c in the VM console. The downside is that now you will have no (known?) way to exit from socat. (I simply use `killall socat` from another terminal).
