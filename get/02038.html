                                        You missed the underscore though, this should be:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                        Fixed. I had it in the sample output, but must have missed it in the command itself. Thanks.

                                        btw, it's good for names like camelCase, but not for camelCaseLong

                                        I think this is a little more robust:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        It converts CamelCaseWord or camelCaseWord to camel_case_word (the last pipe is needed to handle the CamelCaseWord case)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        sed 's/\([A-Z]\)/_\l\1/g' file.txt | sed 's/^_\([a-z]\)/\1/g'

                                        and this is the reverse:
                                </p>

                                        The exports above fix a problem where [a-z] is case-insensitive
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Here's an explanation from the sed man page (Gnu Sed 4)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        [a-z] is case insensitive
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        You are encountering problems with locales. POSIX mandates that [a-z] uses the current locale's collation order - in C parlance, that means using strcoll(3) instead of strcmp(3). Some locales have a case-insensitive collation order, others don't.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Another problem is that [a-z] tries to use collation symbols. This only happens if you are on the GNU system, using GNU libc's regular expression matcher instead of compiling the one supplied with GNU sed. In a Danish locale, for example, the regular expression ^[a-z]$ matches the string `aa', because this is a single collating symbol that comes after `a' and before `b'; `ll' behaves similarly in Spanish locales, or `ij' in Dutch locales.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        To work around these problems, which may cause bugs in shell scripts, set the LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPE environment variables to `C'.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                        Here's an example of a line that was having problems due to the case-insensitive problem. Exporting LC_COLLATE and LC_CTYPES fixed the problem. It has to be done each time you log in though. I'm hesitant to put this export into my .profile, as I'm not sure what it will do to the rest of the system programs.
