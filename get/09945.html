                                        @Fudo It just means the buffer won't be written to disk, and it's not strictly necessary. The dash is the main thing. This works too:
                                </p><code>ls | vim -</code>
                                <p>
                                        If it were in an alias or something the nowrite is handy, but I don't know if it'd be worth typing out to save the disk access. Or is there a more important reason to use it, Unixmonkey?
                                </p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="comment comment0 body">
                                <p>
                                        Or:
                                </p><code>ls | view -</code>
                                <p>
                                        Which will give you a RO view (and you can write the buffer at your leisure)
                                </p>
