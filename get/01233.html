This is very useful if you are using SSH to synchronize files (using rsync/sftp/cvs/svn) on a regular basis because it won't create a new socket each time to open an ssh connection.

                                                                I had tried this before running a command on one SSH and backgrounding it (ssh

                                                                You can also set the options on the command line if you only want the control process for a single job:

                                                                Yes, ControlMaster no is default indeed. It can be useful in other cases to use auto instead, if you don't care to have a socket always open, but you might have several SSH connections following one another. In that case, you don't need the "ssh -MNf" command, and the first SSH command to be launched will create the socket which will be used by the following commands.
