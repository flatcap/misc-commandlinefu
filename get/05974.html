                                                                Very interesting. There is a way to simplify it, though.

                                                                First alter the alias to only delete one entry:
                                                        </p>
              <code>alias histdel='history -d $((HISTCMD-1))'</code>
              <p>
                                                                Now the clever bit. Add 'histdel' the the list of commands that are ignored by the history:
                                                        </p>
              <code>export HISTIGNORE=$HISTIGNORE:hd</code>
              <p>
                                                                This means histdel doesn't need to delete itself from the history and you can still run it as many times as you like.

                                                                Note: I also have aliases to show my history, which don't add to the history.
