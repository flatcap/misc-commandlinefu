                                        By default, screen tries to restore its old window sizes when attaching to resizable terminals. This command is the command-line equivalent to typing ^A F to fit an open screen session to the window.

                                Voted up just for pointing out that ^A F is the fit screen command, which drives me nuts trying to find out sometimes.
