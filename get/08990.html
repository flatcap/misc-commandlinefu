                                                                </p>

                                                                </p>

                                                                </p>

                                                        Unfortunately, Randall Munroe doesn't understand entropy from information theory. The definition is clearly defined as H=L*log_2(N), where H is the amount of entropy in binary bits, L is the length of the message, log_2() is the log base 2, and N is the total possible characters available given the set of characters in the password.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        Thus, "Tr0ub4d0r&amp;3" has 78-bits of entropy, and "correcthorsebatterystable" has 117-bits of entropy.

                                                        Sadly, his reasoning is flawed as well, as discussed in great detail here... <a href="http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/04/bad-passwords-are-not-fun-and-good.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.troyhunt.com/2011/04/bad-passwords-are-not-fun-and-good.html</a>

                                                        If you're going to downvote this, don't do it because the idea that inspired it is flawed. For what it's supposed to do, it does it well, and could be used for a non-flawed idea.

                                                        Sadly, 'shuf' is not installed on every machine. It should be. Some later editions of GNU sort have a '-R option, so you could use 'sort -R /usr/share/dict/words |head -4 |' instead... but not every distro has up-to-date version of GNU sort, either. For example, I can see both are missing from RHEL / CentOS 5.6

                                                        Thus, the reason it was downvoted by me. shuf(1) isn't portable across all Unices. However, last I checked, I didn't need to explain why I voted one way or the other.

                                                        Man that troy hunt guy is super verbose... but after skimming the article I don't see where he says Munroe's idea is flawed. The closest thing would be that Munroe doesn't specify that the total number of characters is important, not using the 4 words. The 4 words are just a convenient way to get a decent number of characters that are easy to remember. All lower case alpha is perfectly fine as long as its long enough. Do the math.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        The biggest flaw I see is that if an attacker knows you use 4 words like this it will make your password easy to brute force.

                                                        I think some of you missed the point Randall was making.

                                                        @atoponce: your equation for entropy is only true for a string which doesn't exhibit "inter-symbol memory" (each character is random and unrelated to adjacent characters). A password based on a word does have inter-symbol memory, so you have to consider the entire word as a single symbol, and N becomes the list of words it was drawn from. Randall apparently came up with a list of 64 thousand words (16 bits). The additional bits show the likely ways those 64k base words are typically obfuscated, so you effectively have a single symbol drawn from 256 million possible values (28 bits).
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        For the 'secure' password, my dictionary file has 98,569 words, so using your equation: H = L*log_2(N) = 4*log_2(98569) = 66 bits.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                        @eikenberry: It's more conservative to consider each word as a 'symbol', so instead of a 25-symbol string with 4.7 bits each (26 different letters), you have a string of 4 symbols with 16.5 bits each. So, it doesn't matter if you tell the attacker that you used this command to generate the password, because he still has 2^66 combinations to try which would take 2.3 billion years to try based on the rates Randall is using (he might get lucky and find the answer in ~1 billion years).

                                                        An important point (the Troy mentions also), is that these rates only apply to brute force attacks via a web interface. I wouldn't use any of these for a Truecrypt volume or any other local or offline system that doesn't inherently limit the attempt rate.
