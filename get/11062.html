					Note: the tar archive must not exist in order to create it. If exists it will only be updated and no already existent files in present search will still remain in the tar archive. The update option has to be used instead of create because the command tar may be executed more than once depending on the number of arguments that find throws. You can see maximum number of arguments with 'getconf ARG_MAX'

					cvf shoud work fine since you're running -exec with '+' at the end; tar is only run once with every single result appended to the end. A favorite use of find and -exec of mine :)

					cvf only works well on some cases. Try it with 50.000 files on cygwin and you will see.
