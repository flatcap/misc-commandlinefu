                                                        Does this require the chosen address to be on the same subnet as the computer from which you are ssh-ing?

                                                        @svg this doesn't work for me. My two devices are both connected to a CISCO 2960 switch. Maybe my switch is being too fancy? My issue is that I'm swapping devices on and off my test network as I test them before fielding them. Each device has its MAC printed on it but I don't know for sure what IP the last person to configure the device used... so I thought this command would be perfect but I can't seem to get it to work.
