                                        Requires that you have 1) a version of resize2fs that contains code merged from ext2online, and 2) kernel support for online resizing. (e.g. RHEL 5)

                                Here's a writeup I did on a more complicated version of this, including moving to a RAID 1 array:

                                thanks also for noting you need CentOS 5 to do online resizing. CentOS 4 doesn't do online ext3 resizing, you have to unmount the filesystem first.
