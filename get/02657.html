                                        Depending on the speed of you system, amount of RAM, and amount of free disk space, you can find out practically how fast your disks really are. When it completes, take the number of MB copied, and divide by the line showing the "real" number of seconds. In the sample output, the cached value shows a write speed of 178MB/s, which is unrealistic, while the calculated value using the output and the number of seconds shows it to be more like 35MB/s, which is feasible.

                                        Let dd use direct I/O to write directly to the disk without any caching. You'll encounter very different results with different block sizes (try with 1k, 4k, 1M, ... and appropriate count values).

                                        What you're doing here is really testing *filesystem* performance rather than disk IO. For actual "disk IO", do what ioggstream said or use hdparm:
                                </p><code>hdparm -t /dev/sda</code>
                                <p>
                                        this will test drive throughput by actually streaming a write off the disk. Use the -T option to test how fast the cpu, memory, &amp; linux disk buffer cache can theoretically go.

                                        The underlying filesystem can
