Rename files with vim.

Opens a list of files in a text editor. Using Vim as your default editor
allows you to use the power of regex substitution and visual block mode to
batch rename files.

Found in the renameutils package

sudo apt-get install renameutils

Do all the downvoters have a comment for why this command is so crap? or
are they the elders of the internet who wonder by and make life more
difficult?
