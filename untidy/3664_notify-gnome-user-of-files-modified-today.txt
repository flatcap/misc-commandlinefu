Notify Gnome user of files modified today

On a Gnome desktop, display a notification that a file modified/created
today has downloaded. I use this in a script with get_iplayer's -c option
so I know stuff has finished downloading ;)

The IFS stuff is to handle spaces in the filename. Command has been
trimmed a bit 'cos I specify a directory arg to 'find'. On Debian-based
systems you may need to install the 'libnotify-bin' package. Notice
-daystart is used to tell mtime means 'today' rather than the last 24
hours.

It ain't perfect but it does the job :P


Hmm... ended up with hundreds of individual gnome-notify message boxes, so
had to exit them all manually. Not quite what I'd hoped.
