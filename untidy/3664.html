          On a Gnome desktop, display a notification that a file modified/created today has downloaded. I use this in a script with get_iplayer's -c option so I know stuff has finished downloading ;)

          The IFS stuff is to handle spaces in the filename. Command has been trimmed a bit 'cos I specify a directory arg to 'find'. On Debian-based systems you may need to install the 'libnotify-bin' package. Notice -daystart is used to tell mtime means 'today' rather than the last 24 hours.

          It ain't perfect but it does the job :P

          Hmm... ended up with hundreds of individual gnome-notify message boxes, so had to exit them all manually. Not quite what I'd hoped.
