Tip #33 / Because wireshark is big and nc is small.

mknod backpipe p; while nc -l -p 80 0<backpipe | tee -a inflow | \
nc localhost 81 | tee -a outflow 1>backpipe; do echo \"restarting\"; done

Listen on localhost:80, forward to localhost:81 and log both sides of the
conversation to outflow, automatically restarting if the connection dies.

socat -v TCP4-LISTEN:80 TCP4:localhost:81 will do the same and is way more
readable

So...
If I get it, which I might not, you're creating a fifo device and using
netcat to port forward traffic from port 80/tcp to port 81/tcp, and you
want to see the traffic too.

How does that relate to you title? Wireshark can't port forward.
