Tip #672 / Concatenate pairs of lines 

The following command will concatenate pairs of lines from a file, with a
comma separating each line.

awk 'ORS=NR%2?",":"\n"' FILE

For example, if FILE is of the form
A
B
C
D
the command would print
A,B
C,D

This works by changing ORS (Output Record Seperator) using a ternary
construct ( expr ? iftrue : iffalse ).
NR in awk is the current line number; % is the modulo operator, and 2 is
the argument to it. Thus, if the current line number is modulo 2, the ORS
is ",", and if the line number is not modulo 2, ORS is "\n".
