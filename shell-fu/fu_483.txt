Tip #483 / /dev/vcs and /dev/tty 

Have you ever wanted to check the content of the first virtual console
without switching to it with "Ctrl+Alt+F1"? Or the second console of a
remote server? Or would you like to send something to the user working at
the third virtual console (not via wall command)?

The GNU/Linux kernel provides two character devices for such tasks:
* /dev/ttyX - represents X. virtual console
* /dev/vcsX - represents X. virtual console text contents
So, to answer the questions use these commands:
1. cat /dev/vcs1
2. ssh root@server 'cat /dev/vcs2'
3. echo "something" > /dev/tty3
