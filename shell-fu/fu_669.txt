Tip #669 / Copy MySQL tables between hosts 

The following command will allow you to copy a table from the MySQL
database on a remote host, to a different MySQL database on your local
host.

mysqldump -h [remote IP] -u[user] -p[pass] from_db from_table | mysql -u[user] -p[pass] target_db

The first username and password are for the remote database and the last
ones are for your local database.
