Tip #820 / Following a log file 

Here are a couple of ways to follow additions to a log file.

tail -f

This tails the log file and the '-f' tells tail to follow the file, so
anything new added to the file will also be printed to the screen.

Another option is:

less +F /var/log/messages

The +F option turns on less 'follow mode'. It is similar to tail -f but
you will have the benefits of less, like scrolling up and down. To stop
tailing, use Ctrl-C and to resume it, press Shift-F.
