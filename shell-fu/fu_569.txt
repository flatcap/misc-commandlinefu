Tip #569 / Remove or delete columns from a csv file 

cut -d"," -f1,5 file.csv > newfile.csv

Will return only the 1st and 5th columns of a comma-delimited csv file.

Thank you very much for sharing this code with the community.  I learn a
lot from shell-fu.  But you might want to document that this example will
only work if your comma-separated values never contain commas.  Fields
containing commas are quoted:

field_1, "hello, field two", field_3

Also, double-quotes in a CSV file are escaped with... double-quotes:

field_1, "I said, ""hello, field two""", field_3

I don't have a workaround, but documenting the limitation might be enough.
 Maybe you or someone else will be inspired to provide an improved
version.

I changed code to
$ cut -d" " -f18,19 file.csv > newfile.csv
This saves column 18&19 in a SPACE (" ") delimited file to newfile.
