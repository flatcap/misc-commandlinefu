Tip #45 / multiple command output into a single program:

diff -u <(ls -c1 dir_1) <(ls -c1 dir_2)

Will show you a diff of files in the root of dir_1 and dir_2

Thanks, this was very useful. I've been looking for a way of taking stdin
for generating diffs (e.g. copying & pasting from different sources) in
vimdiff (though this should be applicable elsewhere too). I found putting
a dummy command (i.e. one with no output) in the parenthesis to be the
best solution...

$ vimdiff <(echo) <(cat /dev/null)

Proceed to paste whatever you want to compare into the two panes..

in ls -c1, what is the purpose of the one "1"?
If you want it ordered by ctime, why not just -c?

"diff -rq dir_1  dir_2"  does prety the same to compare directories and
files, and if it's just dates of files, try whith
