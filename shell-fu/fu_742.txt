Tip #742 / Sort the lines of a file by length 

The command below can be used to sort the lines of a file by ascending
order (shortest first). Change 'sort -n' to 'sort -nr' to sort in
descending order (longest first).

cat /etc/passwd | awk '{print length, $0}' | sort -n | awk '{$1=""; print $0 }'
