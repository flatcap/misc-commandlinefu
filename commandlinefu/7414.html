          Maybe simpler, but again, don't know how it will work with space in filename.

          Assuming you're separating source and destination names by tab characters, try this to avoid issues with spaces and such:
        </p><code>tr "\t\n" "\0" &lt;file_with_columns_of_names | xargs --null -n 2 mv</code>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class='comment'>
      <div class='author'>
        Juluan
      </div>
      <div class='text'>
        <p>
          But it will build something like that :
        </p>
        <p>
          mv my first filename my second filename
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe with -i and mv "{}" "{}" but i don't know enough xargs to be sure
        </p>
        <p>
          And if someone know how to deal with that, because it often cause me trouble for something like that :
        </p><code>for file in *.xls ; do ...</code>
        <p>
          ( yes, xls, because only windows user will put space in filename and yes i'm trolling a little)
        </p>
        <p>
          Because it will run badly with space. And i have never find a way to tell him to quote filename (it always end running with "my,first,filename").
