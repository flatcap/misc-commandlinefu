Check command history, but avoid running it

Terminal - Check command history, but avoid running it
!whatever:p

Check command history, but avoid running it

!whatever will search your command history and execute the first command
that matches 'whatever'. If you don't feel safe doing this put :p on the
end to print without executing. Recommended when running as superuser.

not working on my ubuntu machine or mac.

Pressing +r then start typing the command will show you live updates of
the history as you type. You can also use the up and down arrows to find
the one your looking for.

@cowholio4: i got it working with both ubuntu and os x; you did not
actually type in

!whatever:p

Comment by Williebee 87 weeks and 3 days ago

@p3k

hahah.... thanks.

Still i prefer control + r

Comment by cowholio4 86 weeks and 2 days ago

I can only think that the :p means "just kidding about re-executing it" :)

ctrl+r works better and everywhere.

... or you could just set histverify ("shopt -s histverify") and be done.

On ubuntu also:

history|grep whatever

That will show every time in your history file the command has been called
rather than just the last time.

Agree with C-r

Comment by Erus 30 weeks and 6 days ago

use bash lusers! pkkid is right!

To those who say Ctrl-R works everwhere, try running Ctrl-R on csh/tcsh,
or ksh, Ctrl-R only works on bash and Z shell. While !search:p works on
many more, also it is more continent to type a simple command in than to
use a shell feature, as you can use it in a string of commands.

function hg(){ history | grep $1; }

Then "hg command" will print all previous commands
