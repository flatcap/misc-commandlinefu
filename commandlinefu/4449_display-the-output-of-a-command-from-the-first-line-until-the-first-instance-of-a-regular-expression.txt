command | sed '/regex/q'

Display the output of a command from the first line until the first
instance of a regular expression.

Slightly simpler version of previous sed command that does the same thing.
In this case, the output will stop at the command, and the entire command
will be terminated as well, instead of proceeding through the whole file.



command | sed -n '1,/regex/p'

Display the output of a command from the first line until the first
instance of a regular expression.

If BREs can be used, this sed version will also get the job done.

<your command here> | perl -n -e 'print "$_" if 1 ... /<regex>/;'

Display the output of a command from the first line until the first
instance of a regular expression.

This command line will display the output of , from the first line of
output, until the first time it sees a pattern matching .

You could specify the regex pattern /^$/ to look for the first blank line,

or /^foobar/ to look for the first line that starts with the word foobar.

<command> | perl -pe '/<regex/ && exit;'

Display the output of a command from the first line until the first
instance of a regular expression.

Doesn't display the matching line. If you want that behaviour, you need to
add "print && " before the 'exit'.
