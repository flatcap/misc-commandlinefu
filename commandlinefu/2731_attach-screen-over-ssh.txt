How to establish a remote Gnu screen session that you can re-connect to

Long before tabbed terminals existed, people have been using Gnu screen to
open many shells in a single text terminal. Combined with ssh, it gives
you the ability to have many open shells with a single remote connection
using the above options. If you detach with "Ctrl-a d" or if the ssh
session is accidentally terminated, all processes running in your remote
shells remain undisturbed, ready for you to reconnect. Other useful screen
commands are "Ctrl-a c" (open new shell) and "Ctrl-a a" (alternate between
shells). Read this quick reference for more screen commands:

Two things, the first, I would suggest -R instead of -r (so that if it
cannot find an old session it just creates a new one.

ssh -t remote_host screen -R

And the second thing:

Why do we need the -t option?

-t forces a terminal to be allocated, otherwise ssh will assume you don't
want one since you are only running a command and not opening a shell.
Screen needs that terminal or else it won't find anything to attach to and
exits.

Thank you for this explanation.

This can also be used with Byobu this way:

ssh -t remote_host byobu -R

For that matter, use screen -RR if you figure to expect multiple screen
sessions.
