Send pop-up notifications on Gnome

The title is optional.

Options:

-t: expire time in milliseconds.

-u: urgency (low, normal, critical).

-i: icon path.

On Debian-based systems you may need to install the 'libnotify-bin'
package.

Useful to advise when a wget download or a simulation ends. Example:

wget URL ; notify-send "Done"

Cool, but a more portable way of doing this is using the not so desktop
dependent xmessage which I think is even more powerful. This will show you
the gpl license

xmessage -file gpl.txt

gmessage is an xmessage clone based on GTK+

notify-send is quite good. I was ignorant of its existance, I've been
using something similar written by Miguel Icaza. It's slightly better but
you have to compile it from source.
