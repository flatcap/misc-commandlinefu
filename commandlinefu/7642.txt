View any already in progress copy command in detail

sudo lsof -p1234 | grep -E "(3r|4w).*REG"

If you spot a dubious looking cp command running you can use this command
to view what is being copied and to where.

1234 is the PID of the cp command being passed to the lsof utility.

3r.*REG will display the file/directory that is being read/copied.

4w.*REG will display the destination it is being written to.
