          Live extension of an ext3 file system on logical volume $v by 200GB without the need to unmount/remount.

          Requires that you have 1) a version of resize2fs that contains code merged from ext2online, and 2) kernel support for online resizing. (e.g. RHEL 5)

          Here's a writeup I did on a more complicated version of this, including moving to a RAID 1 array:

          thanks also for noting you need CentOS 5 to do online resizing. CentOS 4 doesn't do online ext3 resizing, you have to unmount the filesystem first.
