Go up multiple levels of directories quickly and easily.

Terminal - Go up multiple levels of directories quickly and easily.

Go up multiple levels of directories quickly and easily.

This is a kind of wrapper around the shell builtin cd that allows a person
to quickly go up several directories.

Instead of typing:

cd ../..

A user can type:

cd ...

Instead of:

cd ../../..

Type:

cd ....

Add another period and it goes up four levels. Adding more periods will
take you up more levels.



alias ..="cd .."; alias ...="cd ../.."; alias ....="cd ../../.."

Change to your taste. Much quicker than having to add 'cd' every time. Add
it to your .bashrc or .bash_profile.

alias ..="cd .." ...="cd ../.." ....="cd ../../.."

By using sed, I can reduce your function by 52 characters and extend it to
any number of dots!

function cd() { if [[ "$1" =~ "^\.\.+$" ]];then builtin cd "$(echo $1 |
sed -e 's/\.//' -e 's/\./..\//g')";else builtin cd "$@";fi }

flatcap, I had in mind something like that although your version doesn't
seem to work for me on Bash 4.0.33.

I also have some reservations about using external programs for a shell
builtin, so I came up with this test function that converts dots into the
requisite number of "../"s.

test() { local a dir;a=${#1};while [ $a -ne 1 ];do
dir=${dir}"../";((a--));done; echo $dir;}

It would be easy enough to incorporate if I could get that test condition
to match correctly.

I managed to get that test to work. I had to unquote the regular
expression. Here's the new command that doesn't use any external programs:

cd() { if [[ "$1" =~ ^\.\.+$ ]];then local a dir;a=${#1};while [ $a -ne 1
];do dir=${dir}"../";((a--));done;builtin cd $dir;else builtin cd "$@";fi
;}
