						Oddly, the isatty(3) glibc C call doesn't have a direct analogue as a command 'isatty(1)'. All is not lost as you can use test(1).
					</p>
					<p>
						For example, your script might be run from a tty or from a GUI menu item but it needs to get user-input or give feedback. Now your script can test STDIN with 'isatty 0' or STDOUT with 'isatty 1' and use xmessage(1) if the tty is not available.
					</p>
					<p>
						The other way to test for this is with 'tty -s' - but that's only for STDIN.

					<p>
						If your script needs to be run in a terminal, this line at the top will stop it running if you absent-mindedly double-click the icon, perhaps intending to edit it. (Of course this won't help with scripts that run in the background.)

					Even when you're not on a TTY, one should still write to stderr before dying. Some interactive sessions don't show up as TTYs and it'd be best if your script didn't fail silently.
