Go to the previous sibling directory in alphabetical order

Based on linkinpark342 suggestion.

Sometimes you have to browse your way through a lot of sub-directories.
This command cd to the previous sub-directory in alphabetical order. For
example, if you have the directories "lectures/01-intro",
"lectures/02-basic", "lectures/03-advanced" and so on, and your PWD is
"02-basic", it jumps to "01-intro".
