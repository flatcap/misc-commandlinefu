print line and execute it in BASH

echo <command>; !#:0-$

!# is the currennt line so far, by using !#:- you can go from the second
arg (it's zero indexed) to the last ($)

(did I understand the problem correctly?)

Alternatives

There are 3 alternatives - vote for the best!

Terminal - Alternatives
bash -x script.sh

+ uname -a
Linux torgerde 2.6.35-22-generic #35-Ubuntu SMP Sat Oct 16 20:45:36 UTC 2010 x86_64 GNU/Linux
+ whoami

If script.sh contains only these two lines:

$ uname -a

$ whoami

set -x
<TBD>

Is there a way to print the line BASH is executing without copy+paste the
line inside an 'echo' command?
