Sort on multiple dis-contiguous keys/fields (can even specify key
number/field from the end)

Notes:

1) -n-1 means sort key is the last field

2) -l is important if each separate record is on a new line (usually so
for text files)

3) -j tells msort not to create log file (msort.log) in the working
directory

4) may need to install msort package.

5) msort does lot more. Check man msort


It's in aptitude, for those of you who don't have it:

aptitude install msort
