          Tee can be used to split a pipe into multiple streams for one or more process to work it. You can add more " &gt;()" for even more fun.

          the tee command does fine with file names, but not so much with file descriptors, such as &amp;2 (stderr). This uses process redirection to tee to the specified descriptor.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the sample output, it's being used to tee to stderr, which is connected with the terminal, and to wc -l, which is also outputting to the terminal. The result is the output of bash --version followed by the linecount

          Cool trick!

          Unfortunately Cygwin has a bug in 1.7 that prevents this from working. AIX also has problems with it - it runs once but hangs after that. I thought it was leaving pipes around but it still hangs if I delete them from /tmp. Any help is much appreciated.
