Test your total disk IO capacity, regardless of caching, to find out how
fast the TRUE speed of your disks are

Depending on the speed of you system, amount of RAM, and amount of free
disk space, you can find out practically how fast your disks really are.
When it completes, take the number of MB copied, and divide by the line
showing the "real" number of seconds. In the sample output, the cached
value shows a write speed of 178MB/s, which is unrealistic, while the
calculated value using the output and the number of seconds shows it to be
more like 35MB/s, which is feasible.




time dd if=/dev/zero of=blah.out oflag=direct bs=256M count=1

Let dd use direct I/O to write directly to the disk without any caching.
You'll encounter very different results with different block sizes (try
with 1k, 4k, 1M, ... and appropriate count values).


nice but.. to play the real game use www.iozone.org or bonnie

What you're doing here is really testing *filesystem* performance rather
than disk IO. For actual "disk IO", do what ioggstream said or use hdparm:

hdparm -t /dev/sda

this will test drive throughput by actually streaming a write off the
disk. Use the -T option to test how fast the cpu, memory, & linux disk
buffer cache can theoretically go.

The underlying filesystem can
