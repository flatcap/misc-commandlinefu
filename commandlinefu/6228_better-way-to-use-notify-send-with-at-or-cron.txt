Better way to use notify-send with at or cron

we don't need to export variables to set a env to a command, we may do
this before the command directly



echo "export DISPLAY=:0; export XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority; notify-send
test" | at now+1minute

I finally found out how to use notify-send with at or cron

You can write a script that does this :

remind <minutes> [<message>]
echo notify-send test | at now+1minute

The simplest way to do it.

Works for me, at least. (Why are the variables being set?)


Thanks aurium, I'd also suggest using a ?here string? for even better
clarity than piping with echo :

at now+1minute <<< "DISPLAY=:0.0 XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority notify-send
test"
