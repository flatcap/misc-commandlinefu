Most Commonly Used Grep Options

GREP_OPTIONS='-D skip --binary-files=without-match --ignore-case'

This is very helpful to place in a shell startup file and will make grep
use those options all the time. This example is nice as it won't show
those warning messages, skips devices like fifos and pipes, and ignores
case by default.
