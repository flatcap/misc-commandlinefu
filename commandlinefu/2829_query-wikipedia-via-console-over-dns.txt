Query Wikipedia via console over DNS

Query Wikipedia by issuing a DNS query for a TXT record. The TXT record
will also include a short URL to the complete corresponding Wikipedia
entry.You can also write a little shell script like:

$ cat wikisole.sh

#!/bin/sh

dig +short txt ${1}.wp.dg.cx

and run it like

./wikisole.sh unix

were your first option ($1) will be used as search term.




mwiki () { blah=`echo $@ | sed -e 's/ /_/g'`; dig +short txt
$blah.wp.dg.cx; }

Comment by qubyte 62 weeks and 3 days ago

We can add some GUI spice to teh absue :P , dep==> zenity

zenity --info --text="$(dig +short txt $(zenity --entry --title="Search
wiki" --text="Enter your search word:").wp.dg.cx)"

Comment by hemanth 62 weeks and 3 days ago

This is simply awesome. In the shell script example, add quotes around the
"${1}" and you can do multi-word searches using quotes in your arg, like:

./wikip.sh "gradient descent"

Script with prettified output:

cat wikisole.sh

#!/bin/sh

COLUMNS=`tput cols`

dig +short txt "${1}".wp.dg.cx | sed -e 's/" "//g' -e 's/^"//g' -e
's/"$//g' -e 's/ http:/\n\nhttp:/' | fmt -w $COLUMNS

philipsd6's version as a function in bashrc:

function wiki () {

COLUMNS=`tput cols`

dig +short txt ${1}.wp.dg.cx | sed -e 's/" "//g' -e 's/^"//g' -e 's/"$//g'
-e 's/ http:/\n\nhttp:/' | fmt -w $COLUMNS

}

You can also search for more than one word like this:

dig +short txt "multiple words".wp.dg.cx

I wrote a wrapper script that takes either 1 word or multiple words and
formulates the syntax properly:

#!/bin/bash

function help {

echo -e "\n\tusage: $0 "

exit

}

if [ -z "$1" ]; then

help

fi

while [ "$1" != "" ]; do

if [ "$SEARCH" = "" ]; then

SEARCH="$1"

else

SEARCH="$SEARCH $1"

fi

shift

done

echo -e "\n\tLooking up $SEARCH\n"

dig +short txt "$SEARCH".wp.dg.cx

echo ""

Comment by omish_man 62 weeks ago

I hate dig.

Why not use:

host -t txt linux.wp.dg.cx
Comment by vutcovici 61 weeks and 6 days ago

Simpler multiple words fix:

dig +short txt "`echo $@`".wp.dg.cx

I wonder if we can do that with French language ( fr.wikipedia.org )

Like with this example : fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tse

mwiki () { echo $@ > foo; blah=`sed 's/ /_/g' foo`; dig +short txt
$blah.wp.dg.cx; }

Sample output:

\"ounce,\" is a moderately large cat native to the mountain ranges of
Central Asia. The classification of this species has been subject to

Comment by ethnopunk 29 weeks and 5 days ago

Shorter version, works with multiple words:

mwiki() { dig +short txt "$*".wp.dg.cx; }

Comment by dorin 28 weeks and 4 days ago

on windows:

nslookup -q=txt shit.wp.dg.cx
Comment by unixmonkey9108 27 weeks and 6 days ago

"slookup -q=txt" does not appear to be valid (i have WinXP+SP3)...

Comment by bugmenot 8 weeks ago

sorry, in mean "Nslookup -q=txt"...

Comment by bugmenot 8 weeks ago

Nice. These dns lookups seems faster than an actual http request.

But I don't like the disturbing " and \ and the missing linebreaks.
Therefore by combining dorin's ID with a sed and fmt I get to:

mwiki() { dig +short txt $(echo $* | sed 's/ /_/g').wp.dg.cx|sed -E "s/\"
\"|^\"|\"$|\\\\//g"|fmt; }
