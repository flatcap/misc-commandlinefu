Get the IP of the host your coming from when logged in remotely

echo ${SSH_CLIENT%% *}

Even faster without the need for cut... :)

I use this to change my prompt to include the hostname when on a remote
machine.

Don't know any command that can give me the ip directly.

echo $SSH_CLIENT | cut -f 1 -d ' '
host -i `echo $SSH_CLIENT | cut -f 1 -d \ ` | sed 's/.* domain name
pointer \(.*\)\./\1/'

to reverse lookup and get the hostname.
