grep certain file types recursively

doesn't do case-insensitive filenames like iname but otherwise likely to
be faster



find . -name "*.[ch]" | xargs grep "TODO"

-exec works better and faster then using a pipe


just add the -i option to grep to get case-insensitivity.

I know its documented the way you say it, so perhaps its a bug I'm seeing.
But as of GNU grep 2.5.4 on Mandriva 2009.1, the "-i" only affects the
pattern, not the filename
