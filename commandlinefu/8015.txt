add the result of a command into vi

!!command

in command mode, navigate your cursor to the line where you want the
command output to appear, and hit "!!". No need to enter edit mode or even
type a ":" (colon).

Alternatives

Terminal - Alternatives
:r! <bash_command>

':r!ls -l' results in listing the files in the current directory and paste
it into vi

What others think

This filters the current line through a command, rather than just running
a command and adding the output to the buffer.

For instance, if you start with the line "example" and press !!, then type
"wc -c" and press enter, "example" will be replaced with "8". (7
characters in "example", plus the newline.)

So the contents of the line you do the !! on are given as standard input
to the program. If all you wanted was to run the command with no input
that might not be what you want. So to run the command and capture output,
but not give any input, you want something like

:r !date
