I finally found out how to use notify-send with at or cron

Terminal - I finally found out how to use notify-send with at or cron
echo "export DISPLAY=:0; export XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority; notify-send
test" | at now+1minute

You can write a script that does this :

remind <minutes> [<message>]



DISPLAY=:0.0 XAUTHORITY=~/.Xauthority notify-send test

Better way to use notify-send with at or cron

we don't need to export variables to set a env to a command, we may do
this before the command directly

echo notify-send test | at now+1minute

The simplest way to do it.

Works for me, at least. (Why are the variables being set?)


Aha. That makes sense.
