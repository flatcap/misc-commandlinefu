          This is a (last resort) way to automate applications that provide no other ways for automation, it would send 'Hello world' to the currently active window. See the manpage (and the -text and -window entries) for how to send special characters and target specific windows.
        </p>
        <p>
          An example:
        </p>
        <p>
          Using xwininfo, I get the id of my XPlanet background window:
        </p>
        <p>
          alanceil@kvirasim:19:51:0:~&gt; xwininfo
        </p>
        <p>
          xwininfo: Please select the window about which you
        </p>
        <p>
          would like information by clicking the
        </p>
        <p>
          mouse in that window.
        </p>
        <p>
          xwininfo: Window id: 0x3600001 "Xplanet 1.2.0"
        </p>
        <p>
          Absolute upper-left X: 0
        </p>
        <p>
          (..etc..)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now I use xvkbd to tell it to close itself:
        </p>
        <p>
          xvkbd -xsendevent -window 0x3600001 -text "Q"
        </p>
        <p>
          Obviously, the best way is to put these commands in a shellscript - just make sure to include a short sleep (sleep .1 should suffice) after each xvkbd call, or some programs will become confused.
