sorting file contents into individual files with awk

This command will sort the contents of FILENAME by redirecting the output
to individual .txt files in which 3rd column will be used for sorting. If
FILENAME contents are as follows:

foo foo A foo

bar bar B bar

lorem ipsum A lorem

Then two files called A.txt and B.txt will be created and their contents
will be:

A.txt

foo foo A foo

lorem ipsum A lorem

and B.txt will be

bar bar B bar
