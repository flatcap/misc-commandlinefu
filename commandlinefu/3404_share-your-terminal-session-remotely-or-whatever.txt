Share your terminal session (remotely or whatever)

Force the user you want to watch doing things into doing his things in a
screen session. Then simply attach yourself to that session with the
command shown above.

Works only if you are on the same machine, of course

That only connects to existing screen processes in the current session.
Not remotely, you need telnet or ssh access to the user account for that,

i DID write that into the description, which mystically got lost during
posting the command.

Added it again

things needed for this to work: (1) they tell me the screen binary must be
setuid, (2) multiuser mode must be enabled via the -x option or 'multiuser
on' command inside screen, and (3) users must be added via 'acladd
username' command. At least that does it on debian/ubuntu systems.
