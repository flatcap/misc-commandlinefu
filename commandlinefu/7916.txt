A nice way to use the console in full screen without forget the current
time.

you can too add other infos like cpu and mem use.

What others think

Wow, that's very cute.

tnks to @flatcap, I learn:

man 1 tput man 5 terminfo

there's so much options to play.

that is really awesome.

Clocks have been done to DEATH lately, but this one is the one I like.

Props!

Really cool

$(date)";tput rc;done &
