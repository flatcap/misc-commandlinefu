cat /etc/services | egrep [[:blank:]]<port_number>/

xuta@xuta-itim:~$ cat /etc/services  | egrep [[:blank:]]25/
smtp            25/tcp          mail

Apply to almost linux distroes.

grep '\<110/' /etc/services; grep '\b110/' /etc/services

pop3            110/tcp    # Post Office Protocol - Version 3
pop3            110/udp    # Post Office Protocol - Version 3

I used 110 as the port number in examples for clarity.

backslash+lessthan or backslash+b marks 'edge of the word'.
