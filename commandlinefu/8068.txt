rm -rf .* matches ".." and thus one goes up a level and wipes out more
than intended.

In bash, .??* safely accomplishes what one intends - remove those .files

The ? matches most characters except "/", thus .?? does not match ../ and
so one is safe.

Alternatives

.??* does not match .a, .b, ...

.[!.]* does.

.??* does not match .a, .b, ...

.[!.]* does.

man bash discusses GLOBIGNORE which does this, but I can't wrap my head
around the logic. GLOBIGNORE=.:.. seems to DTRT:

ls .* -d

. .. .keep

GLOBIGNORE=.:.. ls .* -d

.keep

@greggster: gnu rm complains, but it won't allow me to remove ..

What version of rm do you have where .* can equate to ../*

@NatureShadow: very nice

The shell expands ".*" before its passed to the rm command. What shell are
you using? echo $SHELL should display it.
