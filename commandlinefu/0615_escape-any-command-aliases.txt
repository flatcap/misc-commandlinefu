escape any command aliases

e.g. if rm is aliased for 'rm -i', you can escape the alias by prepending
a backslash:

rm [file] # WILL prompt for confirmation per the alias

\rm [file] # will NOT prompt for confirmation per the default behavior of
the command

This is particularly useful for 'rm', which many distributions insist on
aliasing to 'rm -i' (ignoring the bad habits that this inculcates).
