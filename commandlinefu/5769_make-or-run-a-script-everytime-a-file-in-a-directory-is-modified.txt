make, or run a script, everytime a file in a directory is modified

Uses inotifywait from inotify-tools (
http://wiki.github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools/ ), that is compatible only
with linux.

Usefull when you work with files that have to be compiled.. latex, haml,
c..



while inotifywait -r -e MODIFY dir/; do make; done;
