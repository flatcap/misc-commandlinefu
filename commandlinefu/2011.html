          If you're a moron like me, sometimes your fingers get away from you and you, for example, enter your password when you're already authenticated to ssh-agent, sudo, etc., and your password ends up in shell history. Here's how to get it out.

          I have to use this one quite often.

          My usage isn't usually to remove passwords, but because I've accidentally pasted a large number of lines into a terminal window. Have to use a for loop to delete a bunch of lines.

          You can also remove the command by moving to the command and delete that line. And followed by up/down key (not enter), the command will be erased.
