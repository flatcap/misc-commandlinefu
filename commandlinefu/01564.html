					This is a (last resort) way to automate applications that provide no other ways for automation, it would send 'Hello world' to the currently active window. See the manpage (and the -text and -window entries) for how to send special characters and target specific windows.
				</p>
				<p>
					An example:
				</p>
				<p>
					Using xwininfo, I get the id of my XPlanet background window:
				</p>
				<p>
					alanceil@kvirasim:19:51:0:~&gt; xwininfo
				</p>
				<p>
					xwininfo: Please select the window about which you
				</p>
				<p>
					would like information by clicking the
				</p>
				<p>
					mouse in that window.
				</p>
				<p>
					xwininfo: Window id: 0x3600001 "Xplanet 1.2.0"
				</p>
				<p>
					Absolute upper-left X: 0
				</p>
				<p>
					(..etc..)
				</p>
				<p>
					Now I use xvkbd to tell it to close itself:
				</p>
				<p>
					xvkbd -xsendevent -window 0x3600001 -text "Q"
				</p>
				<p>
					Obviously, the best way is to put these commands in a shellscript - just make sure to include a short sleep (sleep .1 should suffice) after each xvkbd call, or some programs will become confused.
