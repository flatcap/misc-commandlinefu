Display a block of text with AWK

I find this terribly useful for grepping through a file, looking for just
a block of text. There's "grep -A # pattern file.txt" to see a specific
number of lines following your pattern, but what if you want to see the
whole block? Say, the output of "dmidecode" (as root):

dmidecode | awk '/Battery/,/^$/'

Will show me everything following the battery block up to the next block
of text. Again, I find this extremely useful when I want to see whole
blocks of text based on a pattern, and I don't care to see the rest of the
data in output. This could be used against the '/etc/securetty/user' file
on Unix to find the block of a specific user. It could be used against
VirtualHosts or Directories on Apache to find specific definitions. The
scenarios go on for any text formatted in a block fashion. Very handy.



sed -n /start_pattern/,/stop_pattern/p file.txt

Display a block of text with vim with offset, like with AWK

By using vim, you can also filter content on stdout, using vim's extra
power, like search pattern offset!

No more awk of course, sorry.

details :

-e ex mode

-s silent

-c 'ex command' : global + start and end pattern + offset print (p)

-cq : quit


Very nice.

dmidecode | awk '/Core/,/^$/'

Awesome! Awk is such a powerful tool and I always wish I knew it better.
