Instead of looking for the right ip address, just pick whatever address
you like and set a static ip mapping.


Nice, but you've lost a couple of characters from the end.

You need to add '` (single-quote, backtick) to complete the sed clause and
the for command.

thanks by the hint. Corrected.

This could go quicker by just setting a static ip address.

the problem is that I am using it to connect to my ipod touch, and my
router doesn't allow me to use fixed ip using dhcp and mac address. So
this is my best option...

An updated version of the command (cited problems solved):

for i in *;do avidemux --video-codec Xvid4 --audio-codec mp3 --load "${i}"
--save "`echo "$i" | sed -e 's/\....$//'`.done.mp4" --quit; done
