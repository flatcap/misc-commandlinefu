Get all IPs via ifconfig

Fetches the IPs and ONLY the IPs from ifconfig. Simplest, shortest,
cleanest.

Perl is too good to be true...

(P.S.: credit should go to Peteris Krumins at catonmat.net)




ifconfig | awk -F':| +' '/ddr:/{print $4}'

and, a lot uglier, with sed:

ifconfig | sed -n '/inet addr:/s/[^:]\+:\(\S\+\).*/\1/p'

Edit:

Wanted to be shorter than the perl version. Still think that the perl
version is the best..

ifconfig | awk '/ddr:[0-9]/ {sub(/addr:/, ""); print $2}'

 ifconfig | awk '/ddr:[0-9]/ {sub(/addr:/, ""); print $2}'

The initial version of this command also outputted extra empty lines, so
it went like this:

192.168.166.48

127.0.0.1

This happened on Ubuntu, i haven't tested on anything else.

ipconfig getpacket en0 | grep yi| sed s."yiaddr = "."en0: ". ipconfig
getpacket en1 | grep yi| sed s."yiaddr = "."en1: ".

Great, I'll be using this. Thanks.

One question, know a way to have this pull just a specific interface's IP
from ifconfig?

Won't work on non-Linux Unices. Modded down.
