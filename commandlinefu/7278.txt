the same as [Esc] in vim

Ctrl + [

Faster and more convinent than [Esc]

What others think

This is IMHO not really useful in Vim but YMMV.

However, this tip is best used with screen for the copy-mode (i.e.
scrollback):

CTRL-a CTRL-[ is much easier to type than CTRL-a .

You can remap whatever you like to [Esc] in your ~/.vimrc

imap jk <Esc>

^[ is Escape pretty much everywhere. See man ascii or the Wikipedia
article on ASCII.

I decided to just outright switch Caps Lock and Escape on my keyboard.
It's even easier than regular Escape and Ctrl-[

I have this in my ~/.Xmodmap

! Swap Caps_Lock and Escape

remove Lock = Caps_Lock

remove Control = Escape

keysym Escape = Caps_Lock

keysym Caps_Lock = Escape

add Lock = Caps_Lock

add Control = Escape
