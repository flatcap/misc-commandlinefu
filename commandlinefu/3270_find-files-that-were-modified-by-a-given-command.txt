Find files that were modified by a given command

This has helped me numerous times trying to find either log files or tmp
files that get created after execution of a command. And really eye
opening as to how active a given process really is. Play around with
-anewer, -cnewer & -newerXY




strace <name of the program>

Traces the system calls of a program. See

for more information.


Great command!

Another way could also use strace. strace records all system calls made,
and you can even attach it to running processes:

strace -o straceoutput.txt $COMMAND

also use -p $PID to attach to an already-running program. Also, use ltrace
to trace library calls.

Prefer to use lsof -p, see command:

diff

diff <(lsof -p 1234) <(sleep 10; lsof -p 1234)
