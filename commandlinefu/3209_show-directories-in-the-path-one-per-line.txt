Shorter version.

 .... (and so on)

Show directories in the PATH, one per line

This version uses Pipes, but is easier for the common user to grasp...
instead of using sed or some other more complicated method, it uses the tr
command

( IFS=:; for p in $PATH; do echo $p; done )

 /bin
 /usr/X11R6/bin
 /usr/sbin
 /sbin
 /usr/bin
 .

The output of "echo $PATH" is hard to read, this is much easier. The
parentheses ensure that the change to the input field separator (IFS) only
happens the the sub shell and not affecting the current shell.

echo src::${PATH} | awk
'BEGIN{pwd=ENVIRON["PWD"];RS=":";FS="\n"}!$1{$1=pwd}$1!~/^\//{$1=pwd"/"$1}{print
$1}'

Show directories in the PATH, one per line

Removes trailing newline; colon becomes record separator and newline
becomes field separator, only the first field is ever printed. Replaces
empty entries with $PWD. Also prepend relative directories (like ".") with
the current directory ($PWD). Can change PWD with env(1) to get tricky in
(non-Bourne) scripts.

print -l $path

This doesn't work in bash, but in zsh you can typeset -T to bind a scalar
variable to an array. $PATH and $path behave this way by default.


Shouldn't it be?: echo "${PATH//:/$'\n'}"

Yes, it's like plasticdoc said, if not they will be displayed in one line,
space separated.

Comment by inkel 58 weeks and 6 days ago
echo -e "${PATH//:/\n}"

Ya plasticdoc is correct. Using that builtin version is by far the best.
