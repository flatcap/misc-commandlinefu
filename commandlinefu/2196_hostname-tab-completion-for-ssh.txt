Hostname tab-completion for ssh

Terminal - Hostname tab-completion for ssh
function autoCompleteHostname() { local hosts; local cur; hosts=($(awk
'{print $1}' ~/.ssh/known_hosts | cut -d, -f1));
cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]}; COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${hosts[@]}' --
$cur )) } complete -F autoCompleteHostname ssh

Hostname tab-completion for ssh

This is meant for the bash shell. Put this function in your .profile and
you'll be able to use tab-completion for sshing any host which is in your
known_hosts file. This assumes that your known_hosts file is located at
~/.ssh/known_hosts. The "complete" command should go on a separate line as
such:

function autoCompleteHostname() {

local hosts=($(awk '{print $1}' ~/.ssh/known_hosts | cut -d, -f1));

local cur=${COMP_WORDS[COMP_CWORD]};

COMPREPLY=($(compgen -W '${hosts[@]}' -- $cur ))

}

complete -F autoCompleteHostname ssh

Ain't great if you have your known hosts hashed...

Just install bash-completion

apt-get install bash-completion or

yum install bash-completion

or whatever your package manager is or if not, just install from the site:

How can I get this to work for hosts that're hashed?
