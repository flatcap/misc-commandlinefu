How to run X without any graphics hardware

This starts an X server using Xvfb(1) (no graphics hardware required),
then starts a VNC server on the display. Change :1 if there's a conflict
with an existing display, and change 800x600x24 to suit your tastes (24 is
the bit depth, 800x600 is the size). This command obviously requires X be
installed, and also x11vnc(1); both are available via your favourite
package manager. You can also use another VNC server of your choosing, as
long as DISPLAY is set to the display of Xvfb(1). To change your desktop
environment (the default is twm(1), which is rather fail), you can add it
to your ~/.xinitrc file (see the startx(1) manpage for details).
