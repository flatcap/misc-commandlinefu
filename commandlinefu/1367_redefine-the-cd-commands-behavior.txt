Redefine the cd command's behavior

Terminal - Redefine the cd command's behavior
cd() { builtin cd "${@:-$HOME}" && ls; }

Redefine the cd command's behavior

Often, the very next command after the cd command is 'ls', so why not
combine them?. Tested on a Red Hat derivative and Mac OS X Leopard

Update: changed ${1:-$HOME} to "${@:-$HOME}" to accomodate directories
with spaces in the names
