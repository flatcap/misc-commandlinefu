Bind a key with a command

bind '"\C-l":"ls -l\n"'

Now type Ctrl-l and it will list all files

Alternatives

Terminal - Alternatives
bind -x '"\C-l":ls -l'

the -x option is for binding to a shell command

What others think

bind -x '"\C-l":"ll"'

will do the listing without changing anything entered on the current line.
Then you can use it in the middle of typing a command.

Nice ! Thank you

Stick these keybindings into .inputrc and they'll automatically get
sourced. Here's a couple useful snippets from mine:

"\e[B": history-search-forward

"\e[A": history-search-backward

"\el": "ls\n"

"\eL": "ls -lh\n"

"\ex": "screen -x\n"

The ll assumes that you have an alias such as:

alias ll='ls -l'

otherwise, you can just do:

bind '"\C-l":"ls -l\n"'
