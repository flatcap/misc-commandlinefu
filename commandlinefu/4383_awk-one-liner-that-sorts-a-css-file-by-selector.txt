Awk one-liner that sorts a css file by selector

Can you give some examples? It just seems to mangle any CSS I give it.

input:

h1 {

}

zomg {

color: green;

margin: 1px;

}

body {

color: red;

font-family: Arial;

}

output:

body {

color: red;

font-family: Arial;

}

h1 {

}

zomg {

color: green;

margin: 1px;

}
