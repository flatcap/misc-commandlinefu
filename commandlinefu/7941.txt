Create key/value pairs in bash

$ hash="foo:bar"; key=${hash%:*}; value=${hash#*:}; echo "Key: $key Value:
$value"

Key: foo Value: bar

This is a quick and dirty way of creating key/value pairs in bash. Not as
flexible as an associative array, but often powerful enough to be useful.
For example, if I want to rename sets of files in a way that I can't do
with wildcards, I'll create something like 'rename-me.txt'

filename_with_no_pattern:aa.txt\n AnotherPieceOfText:ab.txt\n
/deeply/nested/file/with/no/pattern.txt:ac.txt\n

Then I'll traverse rename-me.txt with a read loop

cat rename-me.txt | while read line; do old=${line%:*}; new=${line#*:}; mv
$old $new; done
