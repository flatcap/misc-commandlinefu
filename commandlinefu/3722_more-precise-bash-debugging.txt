I've put it in my profile.

export PS4=' ${BASH_SOURCE}:${LINENO}(${FUNCNAME[0]}) '

Really nice. You could put this into a function within your profile.

shdebug() {env PS4=' ${BASH_SOURCE}:${LINENO}(${FUNCNAME[0]}) ' sh -x $1;
}

This would mean you could debug a shell script nice and easy:

shdebug /path/to/myscript.sh
