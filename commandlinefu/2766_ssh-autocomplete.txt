Stop tormenting the poor animal cat. See
http://sial.org/howto/shell/useless-cat/.

Edit:

replaced

sort | uniq

by

sort -u



complete -W "$(echo `cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | sed -e
s/,.*//g | uniq | grep -v "\["`;)" ssh

 $ssh myserver.<tab>
 $ssh myserver.insanelylongcompanynamethatishardtospell.com

Add to your bash profile to minimize carpal tunnel syndrome.

Doesn't work with user@hostname but appending "-l user" works fine if
needed.

Works for ping as well..

complete -W "$(echo `cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts | cut -f 1 -d ' ' | sed -e
s/,.*//g | uniq | grep -v "\["`;)" ping

complete -W "$(echo `cat .bash_history | egrep '^ssh ' | sort | uniq | sed
's/^ssh //'`;)" ssh

Could use your ssh bash history if your known_hosts are hashed and you
want to keep it hashed


Really good
