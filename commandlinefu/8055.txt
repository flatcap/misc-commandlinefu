va - alias for editing aliases

alias va='vi ~/.aliases; source ~/.aliases && echo "aliases sourced"'

When setting up a new aliases file, or having creating a new file.. About
every time after editing an aliases file, I source it. This alias makes
editing alias a bit easier and they are useful right away. Note if the
source failed, it will not echo "aliases sourced".

Sub in vi for your favorite editor, or alter for ksh, sh, etc.

What others think

Something similar to vipw or visudo, I suppose?
