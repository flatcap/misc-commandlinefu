          Catches .swp, .swo, .swn, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have access to lsof, it'll give you more compressed output and show you the associated terminals (e.g., pts/5, which you could then use 'w' to figure out where it's originating from): lsof | grep '\.sw.$'
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have swp files turned off, you can do something like: ps x | grep '[g,v]im', but it won't tell you about files open in buffers, via :e [file].

          - Prefer the command in your description:
        </p><code>lsof | grep '\.sw.$'</code>
        <p>
          Useful for "undeleting" files.
