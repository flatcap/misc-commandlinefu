ffo = find in file or ( OR relation )

Will search PWD for text files that contain $1 OR $2 OR $3 etc.

Display:

[file name]:[line number]:[matching line]


You could just set the internal field separator locally rather than
messing around with storing it and resetting it:

function ff { local x=($@) IFS='|';grep -nir -E "${x[*]}" *; }

Nice. Though you should probably quote the $@ so you can search for things
with whitespace in them:

function ff { local x=("$@") IFS='|';grep -nir -E "${x[*]}" *; }

So this works as expected:

ff "foo bar" baz

Thank you.

I changed the command according to your recommendations.

Nice! I'd suggest replacing the last "*" with ".", so that you won't miss
the hidden files and directories such as .profile and .ssh.
