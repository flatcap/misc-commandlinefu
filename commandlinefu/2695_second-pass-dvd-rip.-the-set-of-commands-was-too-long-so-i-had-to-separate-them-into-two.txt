Second pass dvd rip... The set of commands was too long, so I had to separate
                              them into two.

This set of commands will rip a dvd title using a 2 pass mencoder xvid
encode. It will provide a great quality rip. It will rip as close to 700MB
as possible. (note the bitrate of -700000)

Enjoy!

How do i find out what to put in and ?

You can use lsdvd to list the contents of the dvd, and device should be
something along the lines of /dev/dvd, or /dev/cdrom, or even /dev/sr0.
