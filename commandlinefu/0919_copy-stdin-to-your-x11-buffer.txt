Copy stdin to your X11 buffer

Have you ever had to scp a file to your work machine in order to copy its
contents to a mail? xclip can help you with that. It copies its stdin to
the X11 buffer, so all you have to do is middle-click to paste the content
of that looong file :)

Thanks for this! Does anyone know of a way to paste into the kill buffer
instead? Sometimes I am logged into a remote machine and there is no X
functionality. (BTW, Mac has pbcopy and Windows has clip.exe for this
capability)...

Correction: I didn't mean "paste into kill buffer", I meant "copy
arbitrary text into the kill buffer for later pasting"
