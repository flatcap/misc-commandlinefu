Who invoked me? / Get parent command

Terminal - Who invoked me? / Get parent command
ps -o comm= -p $(ps -o ppid= -p $$)

Get the name of the parent command. This might be helpful, if you need to
react on that information. E. g. a script called directly via ssh has got
sshd as parent, manually invoked the parent process will probably be bash

in linux

cat /proc/$$/cmdline

works as well.
