Great one. I would change it a bit by adding a -S switch and refreshing a
bit more often, like :

watch --differences -n 3 'df; ls -FlAtS;'

would change the 'df' part to 'df -h', easier to read ;-)

Wow, this is exactly what I was looking for. I'm copying data from one
hard drive to another, and wanted to monitor the activity. I modified this
slightly to see the subdirectories:

watch -d -n 5 'df -h | grep media; ls ./* -FlAt;'

"-S" and "-t" don't really work together (sorting by time and by size?)

"df -h" is certainly an option, but then you won't see smaller changes in
free space.

"-d" included. Thanks. :)

I love it. FreeBSD does not...thoughts?

[aleida@CERN ~]$ watch -d -n 2 'df; ls -FlAt;'

watch: illegal option -- d

Dunno. "$man watch" in BSD and look for a flag like "--differences" or
something like that.
