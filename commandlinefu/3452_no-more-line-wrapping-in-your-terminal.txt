works on all unices.


function is bash specific. Also you don't need to set COLS, just:

nowrap() { cut -c-$(tput cols); }

Note however that will mess up if terminal escape codes are in your data.
It may also mess up with non displaying multibyte characters like
combining chars for example.

Hmm are there any terminals that support a nowrap setting?

function works in ksh, it's not bash specific.

thanks to have reduced this function, don't know why i did it like this
^_^

this function is for a quickview, no matters multibyte characters i think.

thanks for your comments.
