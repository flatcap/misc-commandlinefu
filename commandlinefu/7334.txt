delete multiple files from git index that have already been deleted from disk

git status | grep deleted | awk '{print $3}' | xargs git rm

delete multiple files from git index that have already been deleted from
disk. this is pretty terrible, I'm looking for a better way.

What others think

I'll just comment it (no alternative version). Your solution is good
enough.

1. It's one of these 'awk which is basically "cut"' cases.

git status |grep deleted | cut -d" " -f3 | xargs git rm

2. You can combine grep and awk jobs:

git status | awk '/deleted/{print $3}' | xargs git rm

3. An equivalent version without xargs would look like this. (Just in case
you're interested in commands you're gona to execute: replace 'sh' with
'less')

git status | awk '/deleted/{print "git rm " $3}' | sh
