-exec works better and faster then using a pipe



grep -r --include="*.[ch]" pattern .

doesn't do case-insensitive filenames like iname but otherwise likely to
be faster

find . -name "*.[ch]" | xargs grep "TODO"

it would seem so yes, but it's really much closer to a tie here. In -exec
{} + mode find invokes as many grep instances as xargs does, and the pipe
has little overhead. What you really want is a recursive grep as
originally posted by sitaram:

grep -r --include="*.[ch]" TODO .
