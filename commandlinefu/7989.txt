Place the NUM-th argument of the most recent command on the shell

<ALT>+<.> or <ALT>+<NUM>+<.> or <ALT>+<NUM>,<ALT>+<.>

After executing a command with multiple arguments like

cp ./temp/test.sh ~/prog/ifdown.sh

you can paste any argument of the previous command to the console, like

ls -l ALT+1+.

is equivalent to

ls -l ./temp/test.sh

ALT+0+. stands for command itself ('ls' in this case)

Simple ALT+. cycles through last arguments of previous commands.

'ALT+.' or '<ESC> .'

When typing out long arguments, such as:

cp file.txt /var/www/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/

You can put that argument on your command line by holding down the ALT key
and pressing the period '.' or by pressing <ESC> then the period '.'. For
example:

cd 'ALT+.'

would put '/var/www/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/ as my argument. Keeping
pressing 'ALT+.' to cycle through arguments of your commands starting from
most recent to oldest. This can save a ton of typing.

<ESC> .
<ALT> .
<alt+.>
<Esc> _

This works if your terminal is in Vi mode
