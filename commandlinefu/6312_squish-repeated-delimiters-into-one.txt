This can be particularly useful used in conjunction with a following cut
command like

echo "hello::::there" | tr -s ':' | cut -d':' -f2

which prints 'there'. Much easier that guessing at -f values for cut. I
know 'tr -s' is used in lots of commands here already but I just figured
out the -s flag and thought it deserved to be highlighted :)
