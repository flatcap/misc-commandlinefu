rename files according to file with colums of corresponding names

awk '{ movecmd = "mv " $1 " " $2 ; system(movecmd) }'
file_with_colums_of_names

text file has to have at least two colums, where the first one contains
the actual filenames of the files to rename, the second one the names you
want the corresponding file to be renamed to, e.g.:

00b7ee34-a8a2-421e-9294-c34d9501a2da_opencast_video_itunes-wcb.mp4
lecture_01.mp4

029273fb-3cd4-40ca-9b3c-9df099997976_opencast_video_itunes-wcb.mp4
lecture_02.mp4

etc.

Alternatives

Terminal - Alternatives
xargs -n 2 mv < file_with_colums_of_names

Maybe simpler, but again, don't know how it will work with space in
filename.
