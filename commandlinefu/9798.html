        <p>
          Sometimes you need the full path to your script, regardless of how it was executed (which starting directory) in order to maintain other relative paths in the script.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you attempt to just use something simple like:
        </p><code>STARTING_DIR="${0%/*}"</code>
        <p>
          you will only get the relative path depending on where you first executed the script from.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can get the relative path to the script (from your starting point) by using dirname, but you actually have to change directories and print the working directory to get the absolute full path.
