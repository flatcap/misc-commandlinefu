You can get one specific line during any procedure. Very interesting to be
used when you know what line you want.




awk 'FNR==5' <file>

Just one character longer than the sed version ('FNR==5' versus -n 5p). On
my system, without using "exit" or "q", the awk version is over four times
faster on a ~900K file using the following timing comparison:

testfile="testfile"; for cmd in "awk 'FNR==20'" "sed -n '20p'"; do echo;
echo $cmd; eval "$cmd $testfile"; for i in {1..3}; do time for j in
{1..100}; do eval "$cmd $testfile" >/dev/null; done; done; done

Adding "exit" or "q" made the difference between awk and sed negligible
and produced a four-fold improvement over the awk timing without the
"exit".

For long files, an exit can speed things up:

awk 'FNR==5{print;exit}' <file>
awk '{if (NR == 3) print}' <file>

I don't know if it's better but works fine :)


It might be better to have

sed -n '5{p;q}' file

so you do not read the rest of a possibly long file.

I suggest following -

awk 'NR == 3'

This will also do the same job :-). But its shorter...
