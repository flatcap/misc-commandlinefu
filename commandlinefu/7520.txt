Make vim open in tabs by default (save to .profile)

alias vim="vim -p"

I always add this to my .profile rc so I can do things like: "vim *.c" and
the files are opened in tabs.

What others think

I believe this is functionally the same as doing nothing, except you have
a bar at the top of your screen with filenames.

If you don't want the list of the files taking up screen real estate at
all times, use ":files" to give you a numbered list of files open. Then
you can switch to any file by using ":b[the document number]" (the 'b'
stands for 'buffer'), and of course you can traverse the open files once
with ":n" (next buffer).

Ah hah! The "-p" option is different in more than just the header bar.
When you use ":q" it kills the current tab only and automatically moves
you to the next one. That's kinda cool.

Yeh, :q and you can also use gT and gt to quickly switch between files,
which I really like!
