If you can install rpl it's simpler to use and faster than combinations of
find, grep and sed.

See man rpl for various options.

time on above operation: real 0m0.862s, user 0m0.548s, sys 0m0.180s

using find + sed: real 0m3.546s, user 0m1.752s, sys 0m1.580s


Available in debian/ubuntu, unsurprisingly as package 'rpl' .
