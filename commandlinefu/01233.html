					Create a persistent SSH connection to the host in the background. Combine this with settings in your ~/.ssh/config:
				</p>
				<p>
					Host host
				</p>
				<p>
					ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%r@%h:%p
				</p>
				<p>
					ControlMaster no
				</p>
				<p>
					All the SSH connections to the machine will then go through the persisten SSH socket. This is very useful if you are using SSH to synchronize files (using rsync/sftp/cvs/svn) on a regular basis because it won't create a new socket each time to open an ssh connection.

					I had tried this before running a command on one SSH and backgrounding it (ssh
				</p>
				<p>
					user@host "command" &amp;), but this is much nicer.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also set the options on the command line if you only want the control process for a single job:
				</p>
				<p>
					ssh -o "ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%r_%h_%p" -MNf
				</p>
				<p>
					scp -o "ControlMaster no" -o "ControlPath ~/.ssh/master-%r_%h_%p" user@host:file .
				</p>
				<p>
					(ControlMaster no is default, so that option probably isn't necessary for the scp, but its included here for completeness)
				</p>

					Yes, ControlMaster no is default indeed. It can be useful in other cases to use auto instead, if you don't care to have a socket always open, but you might have several SSH connections following one another. In that case, you don't need the "ssh -MNf" command, and the first SSH command to be launched will create the socket which will be used by the following commands.

					I use:
				</p><code>ssh -MNTf &lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;</code>
				<p>
					Which adds the '-T' option to disable pseudo-tty allocation, which lowers the memory used on the remote machine.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also note that the -N option is only for protocol 2
