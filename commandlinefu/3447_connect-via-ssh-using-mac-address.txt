Instead of looking for the right ip address, just pick whatever address
you like and set a static ip mapping.



ssh root@`for ((i=100; i<=110; i++));do arp -a 192.168.1.$i; done | grep
00:35:cf:56:b2:2g | awk '{print $2}' | sed -e 's/(//' -e 's/)//'`

 ssh: connect to host 192.168.1.103 port 22: No route to host

Connect to a machine running ssh using mac address by using the "arp"
command


Does this require the chosen address to be on the same subnet as the
computer from which you are ssh-ing?

@clindseysmith yes, it does.

@svg this doesn't work for me. My two devices are both connected to a
CISCO 2960 switch. Maybe my switch is being too fancy? My issue is that
I'm swapping devices on and off my test network as I test them before
fielding them. Each device has its MAC printed on it but I don't know for
sure what IP the last person to configure the device used... so I thought
this command would be perfect but I can't seem to get it to work.
