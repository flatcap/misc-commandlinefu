Select and Edit a File in the Current Directory

This command displays a simple menu of file names in the current
directory. After the user made a choice, the command invokes the default
editor to edit that file.

* Without the break statement, the select command will loop forever

* Setting the PS3 prompt is optional

* If the user types an invalid choice (such as the letter q), then the
variable $f will become an empty string.

* For more information, look up the bash's select command


Interesting. However, need to exclude directories and include hidden files
in the listing.

If you want to exclude dir and include hidden file, try this:

PS3="Enter a number: "; select f in $(find . -type f -maxdepth 1);do
$EDITOR $f; break; done
