silent/shh - shorthand to make commands really quiet

Sometimes I just want to run a command quietly but all that keyboard
shifting makes my fingers hurt. This little function does the job eg.:

if shh type less; then PAGER=less; fi

Nice idea, but why bother with the alias? Why not just call the function
"ssh"?

For clarity? 'silent' is a bit more explicit than 'shh'.

Being dyslexic, it took a few minutes to figure out that you weren't doing
something odd with ssh!
