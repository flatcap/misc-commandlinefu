A "Web 2.0" domain name generator and look for register availability

for domain in $(pwgen -1A0B 6 10); do echo -ne "$domain.com "; if [ -z
"$(whois -H $domain.com | grep -o 'No match for')" ]; then echo -ne "Not
"; fi; echo "Available for register"; done

imeibi.com Available for register
ohthei.com Available for register
ganixi.com Available for register
eicequ.com Available for register
ahnaeb.com Available for register
maihai.com Not Available for register
iuhipa.com Available for register
oonahg.com Available for register
eijood.com Available for register
taxuuc.com Available for register

You would need pwgen installed first, on ubuntu you can get it by apt-get

sudo apt-get install pwgen

What others think

What a fascinating command.

On Fedora, whois (jwhois) doesn't need the -H parameter.

I can tidy it up in a few ways: You don't need the -e option for echo. If
you grep -q you don't need the subshell to hide the result. As you're only
doing one thing in the 'if' statement, you can get rid of it. Also I
shortened the variable name in the loop. Savings: about 25% :-)

for d in $(pwgen -1A0B 6 10); do echo -n "$d.com "; whois -H $d.com | grep
-q 'No match for' || echo -n "Not "; echo "Available for register"; done

@flatcap True ! thanks for the enhancements :-)
