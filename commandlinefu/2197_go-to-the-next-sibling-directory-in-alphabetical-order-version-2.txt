Go to the next sibling directory in alphabetical order, version 2

Another version based on linkinpark342's contribution.

Sometimes you have to browse your way through a lot of sub-directories.
This command cd to the next sub-directory in alphabetical order. For
example, if you have the directories "lectures/01-intro",
"lectures/02-basic", "lectures/03-advanced" and so on, and your PWD is
"02-basic", it jumps to "03-advanced".

cd ../"$(ls -vF ..|grep '/'|grep -A1 `basename $PWD`|tail -n 1)"
