delete a line from your shell history

If you're a moron like me, sometimes your fingers get away from you and
you, for example, enter your password when you're already authenticated to
ssh-agent, sudo, etc., and your password ends up in shell history. Here's
how to get it out.


I have to use this one quite often.

My usage isn't usually to remove passwords, but because I've accidentally
pasted a large number of lines into a terminal window. Have to use a for
loop to delete a bunch of lines.

Wow, commandlinefu just taught me the fix for an annoyance I have had for
years! Thanks so much.

You can also remove the command by moving to the command and delete that
line. And followed by up/down key (not enter), the command will be erased.
