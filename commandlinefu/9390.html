          Suppresses all output to /dev/null. This could be expanded to check for a -l command line option to log the stderr to a file maybe -l file or -l to log to default quietly.log. I'm finding that I use it more often than one would think.

          This works even if there are spaces in any word in the command line.

          Wow, that's a good idea. A few things, though.
        </p>
        <p>
          You need to quote $* just in case the command has a space in it.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shorten the redirects as TheMightyBuzzard says.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shorten the name to something simple, maybe 'q' (too much typing otherwise :-)
        </p><code>function q () { "$*" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; };</code>
        <p>
          Of course in bash, you don't need the keyword 'function'!
        </p><code>q() { "$*" &gt; /dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1; };</code>

          fantastic, i have created 2 aliases for me. one for total silence, the other just redirects err to out for easy grepping ;)
        </p>
        <p>
          function q () { $* 2&gt;&amp;1 ; }
        </p>
        <p>
          function qq () { $* 2&gt; /dev/null &gt; /dev/null; }
        </p>
        <p>
          PS: I do not think quotes are necessary or even good.

        <code>* without quotes fails, if there are spaces in the command or its arguments. $* with quotes "expands to a single word with the value of each parameter separated by the first character of the IFS special variable." (man bash). So it tries to run the whole command-line as a command name.</code>
        <p>
          So, the only valid option here is "$@". It expands to a list of quoted words, just like the original.
