Console clock -- within screen

echo 'hardstatus alwayslastline " %d-%m-%y %c:%s | %w"' >>
$HOME/.screenrc; screen

Configures screen to always display the clock in the last line (has to be
configured only once).

After that you not only have got the possibility to detach sessions and
run them in background, but also have got a nice clock permanently on your
screen.

Every 1.0s: date "+%T"

11:33:02

A console clock with the current time.

yes 'clear;printf "\n\n\n\n\t\t\t`date`\n";sleep 1' | sh

This command will automatically clear the old clock time, and show the new
clock time.

It will also slightly format it.

watch -t -n1 'date "+%r %F %A"'

08:03:57 PM 2011-02-15 Tuesday

Shows a simple clock in the console

-t param removes the watch header

Ctrl-c to exit

while sleep 1; do echo -n "\r`date`"; done

Does the same but without a pipe and a new shell.
