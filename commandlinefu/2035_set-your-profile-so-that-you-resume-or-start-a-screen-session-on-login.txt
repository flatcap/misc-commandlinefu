Set your profile so that you resume or start a screen session on login

From screen's manpage: "Attach here and now. In detail this means: If a
session is running, then reattach. If necessary detach and logout remotely
first. If it was not running create it and notify the user. This is the
author's favorite."

Toss this in your ~/.bash_profile so that you never have that "oh crap"
moment where you wanted to run something in screen and didn't.
