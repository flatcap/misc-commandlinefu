Go to parent directory of filename edited in last command

Terminal - Go to parent directory of filename edited in last command
cd !$:h

 user@host:/home$ vim /path/to/file.txt
 user@host:/home$ cd !$:h
 user@host:/path/to$

Go to parent directory of filename edited in last command

Uses the last argument of the last executed command, and gets the
directory name from it.

Use $!:t for the filename alone, without the dirname.




cd `dirname $_`

User: amaymon
Go to parent directory of filename edited in last command

No idea what I'd use it for offhand but it's short and ugly so what's not
to love.

@TheMightyBuzzard I mostly use it to avoid typing a long path twice in
succession:

cp foo /some/new/long/path/for/foo cd !$:h

(do more stuff to foo)
