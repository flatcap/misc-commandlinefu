          I always add this to my .profile rc so I can do things like: "vim *.c" and the files are opened in tabs.

          I believe this is functionally the same as doing nothing, except you have a bar at the top of your screen with filenames.

        <p>
          If you don't want the list of the files taking up screen real estate at all times, use ":files" to give you a numbered list of files open. Then you can switch to any file by using ":b[the document number]" (the 'b' stands for 'buffer'), and of course you can traverse the open files once with ":n" (next buffer).

          Ah hah! The "-p" option is different in more than just the header bar. When you use ":q" it kills the current tab only and automatically moves you to the next one. That's kinda cool.

          Yeh, :q and you can also use gT and gt to quickly switch between files, which I really like!
