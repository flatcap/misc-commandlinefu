          This is useful for quickly jumping around branches in a file system, or operating on a parellel file.

          This is tested in bash. cd to (substitute in PWD, a for b) where PWD is the bash environmental variable for the "working directory"

          Thanks for posting this command. I'm sorry, but I can't understand what it does. Could you share some use cases?

          I updated the comment for this.

          in bash - PWD is the working directory.
        </p>
        <p>
          To test -
        </p>
        <p>
          mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/cow/d
        </p>
        <p>
          mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/fish/d
        </p>
        <p>
          cd /tmp/a/b/cow/d; pwd
        </p>
        <p>
          where are you?
        </p>
        <p>
          cd ${PWD/cow/fish}; pwd
        </p>
        <p>
          where are you now?
        </p>

          Thanks! I didn't know about the ${PWD/cow/fish} substitution.

          Thanks. One of the things I missed way back in the day when I switched from ksh to bash was the ksh "cd a b" which basically does what you show here. I wrote a function so bash does the same thing but this is handy.
