Delete all files in a folder that don't match a certain file extension

Deletes all files in a folder that are NOT *.foo, *.bar or *.baz files.
Edit the pattern inside the brackets as you like.

( shopt -s extglob; rm !(<PATTERN>) )

Remove everything except that file

Remove everything except that file with shell tricks inside a subshell to
avoid changes in the environment.

help shopt
find . ! -name <FILENAME> -delete

Remove everything except that file

it will remove everything except the file names matching you can use also
use wildcards

ls | egrep -v "[REGULAR EXPRESSION]" | xargs rm -v

User: Saxphile
Remove everything except that file

This is a slight variation of an existing submission, but uses regular
expression to look for files instead. This makes it vastly more versatile,
and one can easily verify the files to be kept by running ls | egrep
"[REGULAR EXPRESSION]"

find . -type f ! -name "*.foo" -name "*.bar" -delete

 enki 13:09:08 /tmp/foo/bar $ find . ! -name "*.xml" ! -name "*.js" -type f -delete
 enki 13:12:23 /tmp/foo/bar $

Delete all files in a folder that don't match a certain file extension

This command is recursive and will delete in all directories in ".". It
will find and delete all files not specified with ! -name "pattern". In
this case it's file extensions. -type f means it will only find files and
not directories. Finally the -delete flag ask find to delete what it
matches. You can test the command by running it first without delete and
it will list the files it will delete when you run it.


Thx! Usual I done it with

find . ! -name ...

Nice tip.

Humph? It does not work in Z-Shell neither in BASH. Am I doing something
wrong?

Got it working in BASH. It's all about 'extglob' option???set it:

shopt -s extglob

and command would work.

Still looking for solution for ZSH.

Comment by Minoru 2 weeks and 3 days ago

For zsh rm -f ^survivior.txt will do but it requires extended_glob

Thanks, RanyAlbeg. That really works!

You welcome ;)

I never feel comfortable specifying the file I want to keep in an rm
command.
