Typing the current date ( or any string ) via a shortcut as if the keys
had been actually typed with the hardware keyboard in any application.

That works in all softs, CLI or GUI... I don't want to waste time to all
the time typing the same stuff . So, I have that command in my window
manager shortcuts ( meta+l ). All the window managers have editable
shortcuts AFAIK. If not, or you don't want to use it that way, you can
easily use the xbindkeys soft.

I you're using kde4, you can run :

systemsettings

then open "inputs actions" and create a new shortcut.

For Gnome take a look there :
http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-create-keyboard-shortcuts-in-gnome/

A more advanced one, with strings and newlines :

xvkbd -xsendevent -text "---8<-----\nToday date is: $(date
+%Y%m%d)\n---8<-----"

For complicated or long paste, you can feed xvkbd with a file :

xvkbd -xsendevent -file <file>

You can simulate ^C ( control+c ) too or others combinations of keys :

xvkbd -text "\C\Ac"

There's no man page nor help ( On my Archlinux distro ), but you can see
online doc there : http://homepage3.nifty.com/tsato/xvkbd/


This may very well be my favorite commandlinefu of all time.

Is there anything xvkbd can't do? The most amazing commandlinefus I've
ever seen all involve this little slice of magic.

@kaedenn : I don't know any kind of limitations.

@matthewbauer : thanks :)

@all folks : the tip was edited to change description to something more
relevant and an advanced exemple is added to play with strings, date and
newlines.

For xfce4, you should use :

bash -c 'xvkbd -xsendevent -text $(date +%Y%m%d)'

in Xmenu/parameters/keyboard/
