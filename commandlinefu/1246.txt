It deletes all removed files, updates what was modified, and adds new
files.

git ls-files -z --deleted | xargs -0 git rm

$ git status
# On branch master
# Changed but not updated:
#   (use "git add/rm <file>..." to update what will be committed)
#
#       deleted:    some file
#       deleted:    some_file
#       deleted:    somefile
#
no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git ls-files -z --deleted | xargs -0 git rm
rm 'some file'
rm 'some_file'
rm 'somefile'

I've used technicalpickles command a lot, but this one handles whitespaces
in filenames. I'm sure you want to create an alias for it :)
