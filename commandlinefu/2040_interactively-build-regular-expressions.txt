Interactively build regular expressions

txt2regex can be interactive or noninteractive and generates regular
expressions for a variety of dialects based on user input. In interactive
mode, the regex string builds as you select menu options. The sample
output here is from noninteractive mode, try running it standalone and see
for yourself. It's written in bash and is available as the 'txt2regex'
package at least under debian/ubuntu.


That thing is awesome! I'm not too bad with sed regex, but it's a nice
gadget with which to tinker.

There is also a package, 'regexxer' that is a GTK GUI-based perl-syntax
regex interface, so you can play around with perl regular expressions on
an input file and see the effect of your changes as you write the
expression. It doesn't help you build the expressions, just to test them
faster.
