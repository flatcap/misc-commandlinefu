cd to (or operate on) a file across parallel directories

cd ${PWD/a/b}

[root@centos manifests]# pwd
/etc/puppet/modules/nfs/manifests
[root@centos manifests]# cd ${PWD/nfs/packages}
[root@centos manifests]# pwd
/etc/puppet/modules/packages/manifests

.. or operate on a file in parallel directory
[root@centos manifests]# vi ${PWD/packages/nfs}/init.pp
[root@centos manifests]# cp -a ${PWD/packages/nfs}/init.pp .

This is useful for quickly jumping around branches in a file system, or
operating on a parellel file.

This is tested in bash. cd to (substitute in PWD, a for b) where PWD is
the bash environmental variable for the "working directory"

What others think

Thanks for posting this command. I'm sorry, but I can't understand what it
does. Could you share some use cases?

I updated the comment for this.

in bash - PWD is the working directory.

To test -

mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/cow/d

mkdir -p /tmp/a/b/fish/d

cd /tmp/a/b/cow/d; pwd

where are you?

cd ${PWD/cow/fish}; pwd

where are you now?

Thanks! I didn't know about the ${PWD/cow/fish} substitution.
