Particularly useful if you're mounting different drives, using the
following command will allow you to see all the filesystems currently
mounted on your computer and their respective specs with the added benefit
of nice formatting.




column -t /proc/mounts

since fuse mounts do not appear in /etc/mtab (fuse can't write there,
dunno if it would if it could) this is propably a better way.


Nice indeed. But some issues when there is whitespaces in mount point.

Ye flipping gods! How did I go twenty years in *nix without finding out
about column?

That's what I'm talking about. These sort of commands are what make this
site shine. Very nice.

to TheMightyBuzzard : I've found "cd -" and this "columnt -t" today - 18
years of *nix :-)
