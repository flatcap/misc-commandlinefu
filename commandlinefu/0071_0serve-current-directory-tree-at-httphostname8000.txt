Cool. I'd been using webfs for this.

This is great way to get something to open without configuring webserver.

I love it.

How to kill the servers? :P

Comment by Meeko 77 weeks and 6 days ago

I changed this up a bit and added it to my .bashrc. My function also logs
into my web server via ssh and forwards a port back to me. It also copies
the URL to my primary selection.

webshare () { local SSHHOST=hostname.of.server python -m SimpleHTTPServer
& echo http://$SSHHOST:8000 | xclip echo Press enter to stop sharing,
http://$SSHHOST:8000 copied to primary selection

/usr/bin/ssh -R 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 $SSHHOST 'read'

kill `jobs -p | head` }

Neat. I've been using a more complicated system:

# Create an index.html, trying to preserve names with whitespace

du -a | awk ?{ print $2,$3,$4,$5}? | \ until [[ -z $L ]];

do

read L;

echo ??$L??;

done > ./index.html;

#Instantiate an SSL web server on port 8080

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout \

server.pem -out server.pem -subj ?/C=XX/O=XX/OU=XX/CN=XX?;

openssl s_server -accept 8080 -WWW

Wow, quoting went horribly wrong there.

# Create an index.html, trying to preserve names with whitespace

du -a | awk '{ print $2,$3,$4,$5}' | until [[ -z $L ]];

do

read L;

echo ''$L'';

done > ./index.html;

#Instantiate an SSL web server on port 8080

openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:1024 -keyout \

server.pem -out server.pem -subj ?/C=XX/O=XX/OU=XX/CN=XX?;

openssl s_server -accept 8080 -WWW

nice ! tfs

Comment by sazwqa 36 weeks and 3 days ago

all of the hacking around detracts from the beautiful simplicity of this
command. I'm totally in love with this. I'd up-vote it a 100 times if I
could. Nice work.

This is a great trick!

Does anyone know similar trick that invoke simple FTP server?

Comment by yorams70 29 weeks and 4 days ago

If you don't know how to kill the server (^c doesn't work) try the
following

kill `ps | grep SimpleHTTP | grep -v grep | awk '{print $1}'`
