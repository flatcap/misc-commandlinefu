					You could do the following, however, brace expansion with {} is not defined in POSIX, and therefore not guaranteed to work in all shells. But, if it does, it's more convenient (although it's certainly not less typing):
				</p><code>cp -r {*,.??*} /dest</code>
				<p>
					Sometimes there are times when I need to cp(1), mv(1) or rm(1) files recursively, but don't want to traverse the previous directory by following ../../../../ etc out of the current directory. This command prevents that. The secret sauce is ".??*". The file globbing ensures that it must start with a dot, and be followed by at least two characters. So, three characters must exist in the filename, which eliminates "." and "..".

					I think you've missed out a dot in the second example? {*,.??*}
				</p>
				<p>
					It could also be written, saving 1 char, as:
				</p><code>cp -r {,.??}* /dest</code>

					What's wrong with 'cp -r . /dest'?

					@flatcap- Nice catch! Edited and fixed. Thanks!

					@Fudo- That command does not copy hidden files- only non-hidden files in the current directory.

					What about one-character hidden files? Like .a
				</p>
				<p>
					I think it's incomplete.

					if you want all files (including hidden) just don't use file globbing:
				</p><code>cp -r ./ /dest</code>
