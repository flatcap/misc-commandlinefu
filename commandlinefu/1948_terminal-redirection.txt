can display the commands and their output to another user who is connected
to another terminal, by example pts/3



script -f /dev/pts/3

Terminal redirection

Will redirect output of current session to another terminal, e.g.
/dev/pts/3

This can be done without redirecting the output to blackhole and without
using tee. Simply use:

script -f /dev/pts/3

Thats it! But the other person on /pts/3 would of course get the readonly
terminal session which I believe is not better than using 'screen' and
sharing live sessions with more interactive shell.

I dunno, it'd be handy for a classroom setting or such.

Couldn't you also just do:

script > /dev/pts/1

or something similar?
