Go to the next sibling directory in alphabetical order

for d in `find .. -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | sort`; do if [[
`basename $d` > `basename $PWD` ]]; then cd $d; break; fi; done

Go to the next sibling directory in alphabetical order

Sometimes you have to browse your way through a lot of sub-directories.
This command cd to the next sub-directory in alphabetical order. For
example, if you have the directories "lectures/01-intro",
"lectures/02-basic", "lectures/03-advanced" and so on, and your PWD is
"02-basic", it jumps to "03-advanced".

Wow.

This isn't working for me. Can anyone tell me why? I'm using bash on both
CygWin and Ubuntu. It doesn't work in either place.

Okay, got it now. The done is missing from the end of the command
sequence. "...fi; done" should be on the end.

Comment by xizdaqrian 73 weeks and 3 days ago

about half the characters:

cd ../"$(ls -AF ..|grep '/'|grep -A1 `basename $PWD`|tail -n 1)"

my ls(1) at least says its already sorted alphabetically if no flags are
given and since files can't have '/' in their names...

ls -v or sort -v would be appropriated here.

xizdaqrian - Thanks, I added the "done".

linkinpark342 - I like your solution! Do you mind if I'll post updated
commands later? It should work for "prev" as well.

gwiener, go for it. previous directory would just change the -A1 to -B1
and the tail to head.

cd ../"$(ls -AF ..|grep '/'|grep -B1 `basename $PWD`|head -n 1)"

If you don't add -v to ls (or sort) you will have the following probleme.
file100.tex will be listed before file30.tex.

Hi guys, I propose this one :

cd $(printf '%s\n' ../*/ | awk '/'"${PWD##*/}"'/{getline;print;}')

;)
