With GNU chmod at least it is that simple.



find . ! -type d -exec chmod -x {}\;

Useful if you have copied files from an OS without a permission structure
(for example, DOS) and you need to disable all executable files but want
to be able to descend into your directories.

chmod -R u=rw-x+X,g=r-x+X,o= .

forces user to rw, group to r, and other to no access.

files will not be marked executable.

directories will be executable for users and groups only.

find . -type f -exec chmod 640 {} ';'

I hate -exec with find, and this pattern quickly expands to other tasks.


Not bad. I usually did that with something like what drashkeev proposed
but I always found it too long.

I never cared to look further the chmod man... Brilliant!
