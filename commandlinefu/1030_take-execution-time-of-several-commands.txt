take execution time of several commands

The last ; is important. example:

time { rm -rf /folder/bar && mkdir -p /folder/bar ; echo "done" ; }

command is a bash builtin


I find /bin/time to give more useful (i.e. less verbose) output.

send the output of the command to /dev/null , to print only the time
command output.
