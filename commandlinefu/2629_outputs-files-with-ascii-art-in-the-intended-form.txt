Outputs files with ascii art in the intended form.

Files containing ascii art (e.g. with .nfo extension) are typically not
correctly reproduced at the command line when using cat. With iconv one
can easily write a wrapper to solve this:

#!/bin/bash

if [ -z "$@" ]; then echo "Usage: $(basename $0) file [file] ..."

else iconv -f437 -tutf8 "$@"; fi

exit 0

"437" is what may be otherwise called "Extended Ascii"
