Reorder file with max 100 file per folder

files -type f | xargs -n100 | while read l; do mkdir $((++f)); cp $l $f;
done

Take a folder full of files and split it into smaller folders containing a
maximum number of files. In this case, 100 files per directory.

find creates the list of files

xargs breaks up the list into groups of 100

for each group, create a directory and copy in the files

Alternatives

There are 2 alternatives - vote for the best!

Terminal - Alternatives
find files/ -type f | while read line; do if [ $((i++%100)) -eq 0 ]; then
mkdir $((++folder)); fi; cp $line $folder/; done

Smaller Code

Better Runtime

folder=0;mkdir $folder; while find -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec mv "{}"
$folder \; -quit ; do if [ $( ls $folder | wc -l ) -ge 100 ]; then
folder=$(( $folder + 1 )); mkdir $folder; fi ; done

Nothing but files and folder

If you have a folder with thousand of files and want to have many folder
with only 100 file per folder, run this.

It will create 0/,1/ etc and put 100 file inside each one.

But find will return true even if it don't find anything ...
