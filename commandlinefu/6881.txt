Adjust gamma so monitor doesn't mess up your body's clock

xrandr | sed -n 's/ connected.*//p' | xargs -n1 -tri xrandr --output {}
--brightness 0.7 --gamma 2:3:4

There is no output, but here's the output from xrandr so you can see the input to the sed regex. It is simply grabbing the first word from any line that says "SUCHANDSO connected"

[UPDATE: Now works for multiple connected outputs]

I woke up around midnight with an urge to do some late night hacking, but
I didn't want a bright monitor screwing up my body's circadian rhythm.
I've heard that at night blue (short wavelength) lights are particularly
bad for your diurnal clock. That may be a bunch of hooey, but it is true
that redder (longer wavelength) colors are easier on my eyes at night.

This command makes the screen dimmer and adjusts the gamma curves to
improve contrast, particularly darkening blues and greens (Rɣ=2, Gɣ=3,
Bɣ=4). To reset your screen to normal, you can run this command:

xrandr | sed -n 's/ connected.*//p' | xargs -n1 -tri xrandr --output {}
--brightness 1 --gamma 1:1:1

or, more briefly,

xgamma -g 1

Note: The sed part is fragile and wrong. I'm doing it this way because of
a misfeature in xrandr(1), which requires an output be specified but has
no programmatic way of querying available outputs. Someone needs to patch
up xrandr to be shell script friendly or at least add virtual outputs
named "PRIMARY" and "ALL".

.

Todo: Screen should dim (gradually) at sunset and brighten at sunrise. I
think this could be done with a self-resubmitting at job, but I'm running
into the commandlinefu 127 character limit just getting the sunrise time:

wget http://aa.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/aa_pap.pl --post-data=$(date
"+xxy=%Y&xxm=%m&xxd=%d")"&st=WA&place=Seattle" -q -O- | sed -rn
's/\W*Sunrise\W*(.*)/\1/p'

I hope some clever hacker comes up with a command line interface to
Google's "OneBox", since the correct time shows up as the first hit when
googling for "sunrise:cityname".

.

[Thank you to @flatcap for the sed improvement, which is much better than
the head|tail|cut silliness I had before. And thank you to @braunmagrin
for pointing out that the "connected" output may not be on the second
line.]

What others think

All that nonsense:

head -2 | tail -1 | cut -f1 -d' '

can be simplified to:

sed -n '2{s/ .*//;p}'

Meaning:

sed -n # don't output anything 2{...;...} # when you get to line 2 perform
some commands s/ .*// # search for a space and other stuff, replace with
nothing p # print the result

Maybe you could use:

`xrandr | grep "[^s]connected"` instead.

This searches in the output of xrandr for the output that is connected,
which may not be in the second line.

I`m sorry.

xrandr on Ubuntu 10.04 doesn't have the brightness option.

Try to use this instead, it works even if the connected output isn't in
the second line.

xrandr --output `xrandr | grep "[^s]connected" | cut -f1 -d' '` --gamma
2:3:4

"grep [^s]connected" searches for a expression that contains "connected"
with any character before, besides 's' (from "disconnected").

@braunmagrin: Fair enough. Try this:

sed -n '/ connected/{s/ .*//;p}'

Fewer characters and only one process started rather than two.

@flatcap, @braunmagrin thanks for the tips!

@thingsgoboom here are a pair of self-resubmitting scripts which set the
gamma appropriately and then use "at" to schedule the other script to run.
Put the contents of these into files in your path (e.g., your home
directory), mark them executable, and then run one of them. As long as you
stay logged on, they will keep running each other at the correct time.

~/bin/nighttime.sh

xrandr \ | sed -n 's/ connected.*//p' \ | xargs -n1 -tri xrandr --output

's/.*Sunrise\W*(.*)/\1/p' | tr -d . ) >/dev/null 2>&1

You'll have to remove the $ from the front of each line, of course. I only
put it there because that's the only way commandlinefu lets me markup that
something is code.
