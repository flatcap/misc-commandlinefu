Send keypresses to an X application

This is a (last resort) way to automate applications that provide no other
ways for automation, it would send 'Hello world' to the currently active
window. See the manpage (and the -text and -window entries) for how to
send special characters and target specific windows.

An example:

Using xwininfo, I get the id of my XPlanet background window:

alanceil@kvirasim:19:51:0:~> xwininfo

xwininfo: Please select the window about which you

would like information by clicking the

mouse in that window.

xwininfo: Window id: 0x3600001 "Xplanet 1.2.0"

Absolute upper-left X: 0

(..etc..)

Now I use xvkbd to tell it to close itself:

xvkbd -xsendevent -window 0x3600001 -text "Q"

Obviously, the best way is to put these commands in a shellscript - just
make sure to include a short sleep (sleep .1 should suffice) after each
xvkbd call, or some programs will become confused.
