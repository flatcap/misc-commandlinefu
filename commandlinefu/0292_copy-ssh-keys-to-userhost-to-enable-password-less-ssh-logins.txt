To generate the keys use the command ssh-keygen



ssh-copy-id username@hostname

easy way
ssh-copy-id user@host

User: matthewbauer
Copy ssh keys to user@host to enable password-less ssh logins.

Same as original just no $ at start


If you need change default port ssh, you can use:

ssh-copy-id 'user@host -p2233'

I think this isn't normally found outside Ubuntu or Debian systems.

Alternativly you can use ?cat ~/.ssh/*.pub | ssh user@remote-system 'umask
077; cat >>.ssh/authorized_keys'? on such systems.

... without the question marks (?) of course.

Beware : without arguments it copies your identity.pub file, which is by
default a RSA1 pub key (obsolete), unless you have already executed
ssh-agent, added your keys, so that ssh-add -L returns something.

Works on RedHat-like systems

Comment by jmcoursi 85 weeks and 6 days ago

Also works on Gentoo, it's contained in openssh package.

Comment by xupeng 84 weeks and 4 days ago

doesn't work across all unix OS. Or is there some installation needed?

cat ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub | ssh user@remotehost 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

ssh-copy-id is just a script. If you don't have it you can google it
easily ehough. Using the above cat is easier though. OS X doesn't bundle
ssh-copy-id so I always use the cat version.

This does not work on CentOS 5.3:

ssh-add -L

The agent has no identities.

So, this tip requires at least some readme on setting up said ssh-copy-id

Quick reading of man ssh-agent did not result in much enlightenment for
me.

On the other hand the

cat ~/.ssh/*.pub | ssh user@remote-system 'umask 077; cat
>>.ssh/authorized_keys'

is easy to understand and certainly works....

vleolml, ssh-copy-id does exist on both Ubuntu 8.x and CentOS 5.x.

As always, read the man page carefully before using this command. It does
a bit more than just copying your public key. It also modifies the
permissions of ~ and ~/.ssh, which may not be what you want if for example
the recipient of your key is user postgres on the remote box.
