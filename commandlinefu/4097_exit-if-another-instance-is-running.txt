I'm voting this one up, cause it's slick, not because it's a good idea. I
learned long ago that the "one in a million" chance of a race condition
being triggered (two processes checking pidof at the same time and not
seeing each other) is actually a sure bet when you're on a machine that
performs millions of ops per seconds.
