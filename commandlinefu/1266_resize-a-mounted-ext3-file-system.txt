Resize A Mounted EXT3 File System

Live extension of an ext3 file system on logical volume $v by 200GB
without the need to unmount/remount.

Requires that you have 1) a version of resize2fs that contains code merged
from ext2online, and 2) kernel support for online resizing. (e.g. RHEL 5)

Here's a writeup I did on a more complicated version of this, including
moving to a RAID 1 array:

thanks also for noting you need CentOS 5 to do online resizing. CentOS 4
doesn't do online ext3 resizing, you have to unmount the filesystem first.
