Another alternative is to define a function:

lower() {

echo ${@,,}

}

lower StrinG




echo StrinG | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]'

Another way to do it with slightly fewer characters. It doesn't work on
Russian characters; please don't vote down because of that. :p It's very
handy for those of us working in ascii :)


I'm getting:

-bash: ${s,,}: bad substitution

What is that trick? That syntax is foreign to me.

I don't know why you get that "bad substitution". Are you running the bash
shell or is it another one? I'm running bash v4.1.5.

This is a case of paremeter expansion of the form ${parameter,,pattern}.
The , operator converts each matching uppercase letters to lowercase. When
the pattern is omitted, it is treated like a ?, which matches every
character.

More info in the section of "Parameter expansion" in the bash man page.

GNU bash, version 3.2.49(23)-release

Doesn't look like it supports the , operator. I tried to figure out
another way to do it with parameter expansion in 3.2 but I couldn't see a
way. Parameter expansion looks cool though, thanks for the help!
