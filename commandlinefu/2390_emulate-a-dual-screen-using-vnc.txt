Emulate a dual-screen using vnc

This command use vnc to connect to another computer and emulate an
dual-screen enviroment.

Example of use:

x2vnc -west 192.168.0.100:0

After this, if vnc server needs an password, will be prompt in the shell.

p.s.: sorry my english

I absolutely LOVE x2vnc. At one point in my job I was doing Windows
desktop support, but also Linux administration. I had a Linux machine and
a Windows machine, and joined them into one "big desktop" with x2vnc. It
was awesome. Best of both worlds.
