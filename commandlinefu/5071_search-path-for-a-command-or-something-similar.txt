Searches your $PATH for whatever you substitute for bash, though not sure
if this will work if you substitute a different shell for bash!


It works as is in ksh-93 (don't know about others) and if you do

setopt shwordsplit

it will work in zsh.

For csh:

find `echo $PATH | sed 's/:/ /g'` -name \*bash\*
