Resume a detached screen session, resizing to fit the current terminal

By default, screen tries to restore its old window sizes when attaching to
resizable terminals. This command is the command-line equivalent to typing
^A F to fit an open screen session to the window.

Voted up just for pointing out that ^A F is the fit screen command, which
drives me nuts trying to find out sometimes.
