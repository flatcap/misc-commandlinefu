Vim: Switch from Horizontal split to Vertical split

This allows to switch from horizontal to vertical split, putting the
current buffer on the right side of the vertical split. To put it on the
right use ^W-H.

In a similar way, to switch from Vertical to Horizontal, do ^W-J (for
bottom) and ^W-K (for top), but you vimers all guessed that one already :P
