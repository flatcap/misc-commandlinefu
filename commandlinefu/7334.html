          delete multiple files from git index that have already been deleted from disk. this is pretty terrible, I'm looking for a better way.

          (much better!! <a href="http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/1246/git-remove-files-which-have-been-deleted%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.commandlinefu.com/commands/view/1246/git-remove-files-which-have-been-deleted)</a>

          I'll just comment it (no alternative version). Your solution is good enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          1. It's one of these 'awk which is basically "cut"' cases.
        </p><code>git status |grep deleted | cut -d" " -f3 | xargs git rm</code>
        <p>
          2. You can combine grep and awk jobs:
        </p><code>git status | awk '/deleted/{print $3}' | xargs git rm</code>
        <p>
          3. An equivalent version without xargs would look like this. (Just in case you're interested in commands you're gona to execute: replace 'sh' with 'less')
        </p><code>git status | awk '/deleted/{print "git rm " $3}' | sh</code>
