					To change to $HOME in that manner you need to set a shell option. In zsh it is auto_cd, hence
				</p><code>setopt -o auto_cd</code>
				<p>
					in bash4 it is autocd, hence
				</p><code>shopt -s autocd</code>
				<p>
					What the option does is allow you to cd to a directory by just entering its name. This also works if the directory name is stored in a variable:
				</p><code>www=/var/www/lighttpd; $www</code>
				<p>
					sends you to /var/www/lighttpd.
				</p>
				<p>
					CAUTION: If a command or function name identical to the directory name exists it takes precedence.

					Holy crap. Nice! I've read the bash manual more times that I care to admit, but I'd missed that one. However, I'll still find it easier to type cd than find the fiddly ~ button :-)

					"$OLDPWD" does the same as "cd -", using that. However, just "-" does not take you back to the previous directory as in "cd -". But it's still very useful.
