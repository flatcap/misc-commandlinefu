Resize a Terminal Window

Replace 70 with the desired height.

Replace 180 with the desired width.

I put it in my bashrc, because by default my terminal is too small.

Neat. :)

Under MacOS using Terminal, if you set the height and width to absurdly
huge values, this will perfectly fullscreen the Terminal window.

Nice. Of course if you're using gnome-terminal, then there's no need:
change the shortcut to run:

gnome-terminal --maximize gnome-terminal --full-screen

Doesn't work in PuTTY on Windows ;oP

If you know what size you want to make your xterm (e.g. the 70 & 180) you
can start a larger xterm with:

xterm -geometry 70x180

(or use -geo for geometry)

and place it in the right place on screen with:

xterm -geo 70x180+5+10

This is typically something I've done by editing
/usr/share/vte/termcap/xterm, but that tends to get reset a lot on
upgrades. This is good because I can just add it to my .bashrc, which has
the added benefit of surviving full reinstalls and new machines (I sync my
.bashrc around). Nice :)

Good to know... gnome-terminal will let you say:

resize -s 70 180
