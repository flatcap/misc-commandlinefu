Negative shell globs already come with bash. Make sure to turn on extended
pattern matching with 'shopt -e extglob'.



ls -I "*.gz"

ls not pattern

Hides some entries from listing.

ls *[^.gz]

 $ ls
 file1 file2.gz file3.gz
 $ ls *[^.gz]
 file1

I've been looking for a way to do this for a while, get a not pattern for
shell globs. This works, I'm using to grab logs from a remote server via
scp.


that should be `shopt -s extglob`.
