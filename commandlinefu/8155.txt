function to edit your history file

eh () { history -a ; vi ~/.bash_history ; history -r ; }

eh stands for Edit History

.

Frequently, I'll mistype a command, and then step back through my history
and correct the command. As a result, both the correct and incorrect
commands are in my history file. I wanted a simple way to remove the
incorrect command so I don't run it by mistake.

.

When running this function, first the ~/bash_history file is updated, then
you edit the file in vi, and then the saved history file is loaded back
into memory for current usage.

.

while in vi, remember that `Shift-G` sends you to the bottom of the file,
and `dd` removes a line.

.

this command is different than bash built-in `fc` because it does not run
the command after editing.

What others think

Wouldn't history -d #, where # is the number of the mistyped command, have
been faster more efficient?
