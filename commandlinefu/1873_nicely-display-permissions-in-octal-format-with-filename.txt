Since the original command (#1873) didn't work on FreeBSD whose stat lacks
the "-c" switch, I wrote an alternative that does. This command shows also
the fourth digit of octal format permissions which yields the sticky bit
information.


Huh. Didn't know stat let you format the output manually like that.

When in doubt, ask a `man`
