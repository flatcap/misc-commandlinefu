uniq for unsorted data

Terminal - uniq for unsorted data
awk '!_[$0]++{print}'

User: dz
uniq for unsorted data

Maybe I'm missing something, but:

a - I can't see how this works

b - it doesn't seem to work

...Create 3 line file test.txt:

'$ cat test.txt:




'$ awk '!_[$0]++{print}' test.txt




Am I being thick?

How about:

sort -u

g__j: it does 'uniq' but without requiring (or doing) sorting;

cat >test






awk '!_[$0]++{print}' < test




You can actually shorten it to:

awk '!_[$0]++'

>>How about:

>>sort -u

I think this has several advantages:

* No need for the overhead of a sort

* Can be embedded in an awk conditional statement. for example:

printf "a\nb\na\nc\na\nc\n" | awk '{if(!_[$0]++){print}}'

* Can be inverted. To show only values that have been seen before. For
example:

printf "a\nb\na\nc\na\nc\n" | awk '{if(_[$0]++){print}}'
