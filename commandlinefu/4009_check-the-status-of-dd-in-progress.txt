check the status of 'dd' in progress

Check the status of a 'dd' in progress. useful when creating very large
dumps and want to see how far along it is. Sending the kill -USR1 forces
dd to dump it's progress to stdout

while killall -USR1 dd; do sleep 5; done

check the status of 'dd' in progress (OS X)

"killall -USR1 dd" does not work in OS X for me. However, sending INFO
instead of USR1 works.
