Runs previous command replacing foo by bar every time that foo appears

Terminal - Runs previous command replacing foo by bar every time that foo
appears
!!:gs/foo/bar

Runs previous command replacing foo by bar every time that foo appears

Very useful for rerunning a long command changing some arguments globally.

As opposed to ^foo^bar, which only replaces the first occurrence of foo,
this one changes every occurrence.

This is also very useful for debian aptitude commands:

aptitude search bzr sudo !!:s/search/install

If you do a sudo ^search^install it won't work.

how can we make this print instead of running it? I tried !!:pgs/foo/bar
and didn't work ;)

@alperyilmaz Close! You're just missing another colon:

!!:p:gs/foo/bar

Modifiers ('gs' and 'p' here) are colon-separated. It seems as though
there should be a colon between the 'g' and 's' too, but we leave it out
because the 'g' only works in conjunction with 's'. If you used it on its
own it would have no effect.

what about iterative operations where you replace foo with foo1, then foo1
with foo2, etc ?
