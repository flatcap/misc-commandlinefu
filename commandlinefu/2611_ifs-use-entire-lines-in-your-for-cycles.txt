IFS - use entire lines in your for cycles

When you use a "for" construct, it cycles on every word. If you want to
cycle on a line-by-line basis (and, well, you can't use xargs -n1 :D), you
can set the IFS variable to .


Not bad. Here's an alternative using read (this doesn't require you to
change IFS)

while read i; do echo "$i"; done < file

(You can cat the file into the while, if you prefer)

If you *do* want to alter IFS, you can do it more simply (in bash at
least) like this:

export IFS=$'\n'

A good idea is also to start with a OLDIFS=$IFS

Then your loop

Then back to real life with IFS=$OLDIFS

You can avoid problems by doing this
