Add a line from 1 file after every line of another (shuffle files
together)

After every line in targetfile (empty lines included) insert in a line
from addfile. "Save" results to savefile. Addfile should be longer than
targetfile since this doesn't loop back to the top of addfile.

/^/R addfile -- says for every line that matches "has a start of line"
output a line from the file addfile.

> savefile (optional) -- redirect output to savefile file.
