convert a line to a space

Terminal - convert a line to a space
cat file | tr '\n' ''

User: bortoelnino
convert a line to a space



echo $(cat file)

User: tlacuache
convert a line to a space
sed 's/.*/ /'

User: putnamhill
convert a line to a space

The first version printed:

tr: empty string2

The second version printed:

sed: -i may not be used with stdin

Maybe I misunderstood the orginal problem.


The "cat" isn't really necessary since you can use redirection like this:

< file tr '\n' ' '

or this:

tr '\n' ' ' < file
