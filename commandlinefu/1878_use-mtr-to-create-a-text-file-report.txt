Use mtr to create a text file report

The report mode of mtr produces a text formated result of the mtr run
using the number of ping cycles stated by the command. This text file
could then be attached to an email with ease.

I use this also without the ">" portion when writing email from within
mutt using VI from the command mode with ":r !mtr --report --report-cycles
