Change to $HOME - zsh, bash4

To change to $HOME in that manner you need to set a shell option. In zsh
it is auto_cd, hence

setopt -o auto_cd

in bash4 it is autocd, hence

shopt -s autocd

What the option does is allow you to cd to a directory by just entering
its name. This also works if the directory name is stored in a variable:

www=/var/www/lighttpd; $www

sends you to /var/www/lighttpd.

CAUTION: If a command or function name identical to the directory name
exists it takes precedence.

Holy crap. Nice! I've read the bash manual more times that I care to
admit, but I'd missed that one. However, I'll still find it easier to type
cd than find the fiddly ~ button :-)

"$OLDPWD" does the same as "cd -", using that. However, just "-" does not
take you back to the previous directory as in "cd -". But it's still very
useful.

just "cd" does the same. takes you home wherever you are.
