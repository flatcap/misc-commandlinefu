The pee command is in the moreutils package.

echo "uptime" | tee >(ssh host1) >(ssh host2) >(ssh host3)

run command on a group of nodes in parallel redirecting outputs

Do the same as pssh, just in shell syntax.

Put your hosts in hostlist, one per line.

Command outputs are gathered in output and error directories.

Parallel is from https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/parallel/

Other examples would be:

(echo foss.org.my; echo www.debian.org; echo www.freenetproject.org) |
parallel traceroute

seq -f %04g 0 9999 | parallel -X rm pict{}.jpg


pdsh

It would be more readable using Parallel
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/parallel/

seq 1 5 | parallel ssh {} uptime
