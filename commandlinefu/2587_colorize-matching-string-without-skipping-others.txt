Colorize matching string without skipping others

this is useful to highlight only some code without losing other lines (eg.
software, logs, scripts)



tail -F file | egrep --color 'pattern|$'

User: sklm
tail, with specific pattern colored
sed 's/pattern/^[[1m&^[[0m/g'

User: rmcb
Bold matching string without skipping others

You should explain yourself a bit better.

This is a very subtle but very useful idea.

By adding an empty search string to egrep (the "|" on the end), you've
invented a "cat" that highlights things.

Very nice.
