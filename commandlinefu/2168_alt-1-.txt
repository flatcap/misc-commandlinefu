alt + 1 .

Terminal - alt + 1 .
alt + 1 .

User: elementa13
alt + 1 .

alt + number + dot will insert last command argument at $number place, alt
+ 0 + . will print last command name. For example

ls /tmp /var ls /usr /home

alt + 1 + . will result in '/usr' , if you press alt + . again, it will
result in '/tmp'

alt + 0 + . -> 'ls'

Note that you still need to hold alt while hitting '.'

I was confused at first.
