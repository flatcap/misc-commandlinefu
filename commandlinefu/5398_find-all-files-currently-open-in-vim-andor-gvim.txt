Catches .swp, .swo, .swn, etc.

If you have access to lsof, it'll give you more compressed output and show
you the associated terminals (e.g., pts/5, which you could then use 'w' to
figure out where it's originating from): lsof | grep '\.sw.$'

If you have swp files turned off, you can do something like: ps x | grep
'[g,v]im', but it won't tell you about files open in buffers, via :e
[file].


- Prefer the command in your description:

lsof | grep '\.sw.$'

Useful for "undeleting" files.
