A quick find command to identify all TAR files in a given path, extract a
list of files contained within the tar, then search for a given string in
the filelist. Returns to the user as a list of TAR files found (enclosed
in []) followed by any matching files that exist in that archive. TAR can
easily be swapped for JAR if required.
