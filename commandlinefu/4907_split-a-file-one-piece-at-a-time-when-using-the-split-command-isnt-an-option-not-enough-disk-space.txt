Split a file one piece at a time, when using the split command isn't an
option (not enough disk space)

bs = buffer size (basically defined the size of a "unit" used by count and
skip)

count = the number of buffers to copy (16m * 32 = 1/2 gig)

skip = (32 * 2) we are grabbing piece 3...which means 2 have already been
written so skip (2 * count)

i will edit this later if i can to make this all more understandable
