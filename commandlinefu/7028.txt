Convert first letter of string to uppercase

string="${string^}"

string="hello"
string="${string^}"
echo $string
Hello

Let bash do the work by converting the initial of a string to an uppercase

What others think

^^ will do all characters, comma and double-comma will covert to
lowercase. ~ toggles the first character of each word, ~~ toggles all
characters. To title case a string:

string='mIXed uP CAse' string=${string,,} string=${string~} echo "$string"

Mixed Up Case

By the way, all of this requires Bash 4.
