List all TCP opened ports on localhost in LISTEN mode

Alternative of OJM snippet :

This one show the IP too, where ports bind. It's very important, because
if there's only 127.0.0.1 instead of 0.0.0.0, connections from internet
are rejected.

time { i=0; while [ $(( i < 65535 )) -eq 1 ] ; do nc -zw2 localhost
$((++i)) && echo port $i opened ; done; }

 port 22 opened
 port 80 opened
 port 631 opened
 port 3306 opened
 port 3690 opened
 port 6665 opened
 port 6666 opened

list all opened ports on host

in loop, until the last port (65535), list all opened ports on host.

in the sample I used localhost, but you can replace with any host to test.
