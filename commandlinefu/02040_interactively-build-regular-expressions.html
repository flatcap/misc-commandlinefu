					txt2regex can be interactive or noninteractive and generates regular expressions for a variety of dialects based on user input. In interactive mode, the regex string builds as you select menu options. The sample output here is from noninteractive mode, try running it standalone and see for yourself. It's written in bash and is available as the 'txt2regex' package at least under debian/ubuntu.

					That thing is awesome! I'm not too bad with sed regex, but it's a nice gadget with which to tinker.

					There is also a package, 'regexxer' that is a GTK GUI-based perl-syntax regex interface, so you can play around with perl regular expressions on an input file and see the effect of your changes as you write the expression. It doesn't help you build the expressions, just to test them faster.
