echo "http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com" | sed
-e's/%\([0-9A-F][0-9A-F]\)/\\\\\x\1/g' | xargs echo -e

http://www.google.com

Works under bash on linux. just alter the '-e' option to its corresponding
equivalence in your system to execute escape characters correctly.



printf $(echo -n $1 | sed
's/\\/\\\\/g;s/\(%\)\([0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]\)/\\x\2/g')

 Hello%20World
 gives
 Hello World

 \unescaped!

My version uses printf and command substitution ($()) instead of echo -e
and xargs, this is a few less chars, but not real substantive difference.

Also supports lowercase hex letters and a backslash (\) will make it
through unescaped

perl -pe 's/%([0-9a-f]{2})/sprintf("%s", pack("H2",$1))/eig'

using perl, to encode/decode ::

echo "$1" | perl -MURI::Escape -lne 'print uri_escape($_)' echo "$1" |
perl -MURI::Escape -lne 'print uri_unescape($_)'

Well I actually wrote a script for encoding, as a part, dicoding is one
functionality of that script, Its looks easy to decode with one command
line, thats why I posted in commandlinefu. If you want the entire script,
Here is the link,
